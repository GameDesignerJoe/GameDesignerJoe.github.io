# Never Played - TODO List


- Look into getting ride of all the progress bars you have extra.
- The friends check only seems to run when you're in that side page.
- You had a faulty check on mobile for friends lists. 
- Fix the alignment on the friends page button.
- Need to change the button messaging in friends list once it's all done. 
- The library saying it's confirmed all the games seems sus and not something that's useful. 
- The showcase buttons on mobile don't look good. 
- Can't get the videos to play of the games. 
- Get the export to be readable by displaying the name of the game.
- Get more of a Gallery view of the games you need to play.
- Need to figure out where to get good images.
- A better way to tell if a friend has a good grasp or love of the game beyond 50+ hours.
- An actual Perfect Match that hits all 5 "Must Play!" 
- More stat info: Steam achievements 
- Check if you really need genres and if it'll speed up your get.
- You don't need three names for the games I think.
- It takes forever to load the content? Is there a way to see what's taking so long and see if we can speed any of that up?
- Remove the (Weekend Game) tags from the Median play time.
- Get the playtime to be the second thing in the list below releast date. Actually make it the top and move release date to the very bottom.
