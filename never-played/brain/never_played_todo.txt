# Never Played - TODO List

## High Priority (Core Functionality)

### 1. ✅ Learn Vercel auto-deploy workflow (DONE)
- Push to GitHub main branch → auto-deploys to Vercel
- No manual action needed after initial setup
- Test: Make small change, push to GitHub, verify deploy

### 2. ✅ Add Steam store page links to games (DONE)
- Click game card → opens `steam://store/{appId}` (launches Steam app)
- Target: `_blank` to open in new tab
- Add "View in Steam Store" button or make entire card clickable

### 3. ✅ Implement "Played Elsewhere" feature (DONE)
- Separate from blacklist (different localStorage key: `playedElsewhere`)
- Button on game cards: "🎮 Played Elsewhere"
- Affects stats: counts toward "Tried" percentage
- Show "✅ Played Elsewhere" badge instead of "❌ Never Played"
- Exclude from "Never Played" count
- Add reset option for played elsewhere list

### 4. Add Cost Per Hour / Cost Per Minute analytics
- **New stat card:** Show library value efficiency
- Calculate total money spent (from SteamSpy price data)
- Calculate cost per hour played: `Total $ / Total Hours`
- Calculate cost per minute: `Total $ / Total Minutes`
- Display in Library Stats section as 6th stat
- Format: "$X.XX per hour" or "$X.XX per minute"
- Show "Calculating..." while price data loads
- Handle games with no price data (free games, removed from store)
- Consider: Only count played games vs all owned games?

---

## Bug Fixes

### 4. Verify "Last New Game" stat calculation
- **Issue:** Need to verify how often the "Last New Game" stat updates
- Check if it only calculates on initial load or updates dynamically
- Ensure rtime_last_played is properly read from Steam API
- Test with different game scenarios (1-120 minute playtime range)
- Verify day calculation is accurate

### 5. Debug tag filtering issue
- **Issue:** "The Wolf Among Us" (98% rating) disappears when "Singleplayer" selected
- Check if SteamSpy returns correct tags for this game
- Verify filtering logic isn't excluding it incorrectly
- Log tags to console for debugging
- Test with multiple games that should have "Singleplayer" tag

### 5. Review tag accuracy
- Display tags on game cards in library view
- Verify SteamSpy tags match Steam's actual tags
- Consider showing top 3-5 tags per game
- Add visual tag chips/badges to game cards
- Make tags clickable to filter by that tag

### 6. Verify "Oldest App ID" sorting
- **Issue:** App ID 115100 appears but unclear if truly "old"
- Test case: Compare against known old games (Counter-Strike = App ID 10)
- Research what App ID 115100 actually is
- May need better sorting logic or actual release dates
- Consider if App ID is reliable proxy for age

## Feature Improvements

### 7. Remove/disable "Sort by Release Date" temporarily
- Currently broken or using placeholder data
- Gray out option or remove from dropdown
- Re-enable after implementing proper release date fetching from SteamSpy
- Add tooltip: "Coming soon"

### 8. Add exclusion filters for VR and Multiplayer games
- **New filter options:** Checkboxes to exclude certain game types
- "🚫 Exclude VR Games" checkbox
- "🚫 Exclude Multiplayer Games" checkbox
- Uses SteamSpy tag data to identify games
- VR tags: "VR", "VR Only", "VR Supported"
- Multiplayer tags: "Multiplayer", "Online Co-Op", "Co-op", "MMO", "Massively Multiplayer"
- Combine with existing tag filters (AND logic)
- Save exclusion preferences in localStorage
- Show count: "(X VR games excluded)" when active

### 9. UI/UX polish
**Collapsible sections:**
- Collapsible Steam ID input section (after first use)
- Collapsible Library Stats section
- Remember collapse state in localStorage

**Responsive design:**
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Readable text sizes on small screens

**User feedback:**
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error messages with helpful context
- Success confirmations for actions
- Progress indicators for long operations

### 9. Additional feature brainstorming
- **Random game picker button:** "Feeling lucky?" - picks truly random game
- **Play streak tracking:** Track consecutive days playing new games
- **Game length estimates:** Integrate HLTB data more prominently
- **Genre mood selector:** "I feel like playing..." → filter by mood/genre
- **Share library stats:** Generate shareable image/link of stats

## Long-term / Research

### 10. Steam Store API integration
**Benefits:**
- Game descriptions/synopsis
- Screenshots and media
- Detailed review breakdowns
- Price information
- More accurate metadata

**Trade-offs:**
- Slower load times (additional API calls)
- More complex caching logic
- Rate limiting concerns
- May need separate endpoint per game

**Implementation approach:**
- Start with on-demand fetching (only when user clicks game)
- Cache aggressively to avoid repeated calls
- Show loading state while fetching
- Graceful degradation if API fails

### 11. Mobile Support
- Get Steam app to open when selecting a link on mobile.

### 12. Badges
- Do another pass on badges you can earn just by the make up of your Steam game account:
    - Old Gamer
    - Well Played
    - Hoarder
    - Solo
    - Half Way There
    - etc.

## To Consider (Future Ideas)

### Quality of Life Improvements
- **Remember last Steam ID:** Save in localStorage, pre-populate input field
- **Show game thumbnails:** Display game icons in suggestion card and library
- **"Currently Playing" status:** Mark games you're actively playing
- **Export stats as image:** Generate shareable screenshot of library stats for social media
- **Better game card design:** More visual polish, hover effects, card animations

### Discovery Features
- **Similar games suggestions:** Based on shared tags with games you've played
- **Hidden gems filter:** High rating (90%+) + low ownership (<100k players)
- **Quick wins filter:** Show only games with HLTB < 5 hours
- **Daily/weekly challenges:** Gamification - "Try 3 horror games this week"
- **Genre deep dive:** "Explore your RPG backlog" feature
- **Decade challenges:** "Play a game from each decade you own"

### Data Improvements
- **Longer cache duration:** Store SteamSpy data for 14 days instead of 7
- **Show last updated timestamp:** Display when cached data was fetched
- **Manual refresh button:** Force re-fetch stale data for specific games
- **Bulk re-cache:** Update all cached data older than X days
- **Cache size management:** Clear old cache entries automatically

- **Value analysis:** Total spent vs hours played
- **Completion forecast:** "At this rate, you'll finish your backlog in X years"

### Gamification Enhancements
- **Achievement system:** Beyond current badges - "Decade Master", "Genre Tourist"
- **Leaderboards (optional):** Compare with friends or global
- **Milestone celebrations:** Animated celebration when hitting 25% tried
- **Streak bonuses:** Extra XP for maintaining daily play streaks
- **Level system rewards:** Unlock new features at certain levels

## Notes

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix bugs (#4, #6) - broken functionality hurts user experience
2. Add core features (#2 links, #3 played elsewhere) - high value, moderate effort
3. Polish UI (#7, #8) - improves usability
4. Research long-term (#10) - only if other features prove insufficient

**Development Philosophy:**
- Keep it simple - avoid feature bloat
- User value first - does this help people play games?
- Performance matters - fast is better than pretty
- Mobile-friendly - many users browse on phones

**Technical Debt to Watch:**
- SteamSpy rate limiting (currently 10 parallel requests)
- localStorage size limits (5-10MB)
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Error handling consistency

---

## Success Metrics to Track

After features are implemented, measure:
- **Engagement:** Do users return after first visit?
- **Discovery:** How many "never played" games get tried after using the app?
- **Suggestion quality:** Do users click suggested games?
- **Feature usage:** Which features get used most?
- **Load times:** Is the app fast enough?
