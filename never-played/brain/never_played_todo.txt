# Never Played - TODO List


- Still don't see it auto update the friends list.
- You had a faulty check on mobile for friends lists. 
- Get the export to be readable by displaying the name of the game.
- A better way to tell if a friend has a good grasp or love of the game beyond 50+ hours.
- More stat info: Steam achievements (Only if it helps you get people to play more games)

## 🚀 Long-term / Research
- Hidding Games:
  - Not doing it because it fucks with everything in your library.
  - Total games played, playtime, your rankings among your friends, etc. 
  - You're just stuck with them. 
  - At most you could do a hide in library, where you just don't see them, but they are still counted in every other way.
