# Never Played - TODO List


- Get the playtime to be the second thing in the list below releast date. Actually make it the top and move release date to the very bottom. 
- The friends check only seems to run when you're in that side page.
- You had a faulty check on mobile for friends lists. 
- Import doesn't seem to work on mobile. 
- Look into getting ride of all the progress bars you have extra.
- The library saying it's confirmed all the games seems sus and not something that's useful. 
- The showcase buttons on mobile don't look good. 
- Get the export to be readable by displaying the name of the game.
- A better way to tell if a friend has a good grasp or love of the game beyond 50+ hours.
- Can't get the videos to play of the games. 
- An actual Perfect Match that hits all 5 "Must Play!" 
- More stat info: Steam achievements (Only if it helps you get people to play more games)


### 3. "Get Back In" view for low-playtime games
- New filter/view for games with 1-10 hours played
- "Games you started but didn't finish"
- Helps rediscover games you tried but abandoned
- Show last played date
- Separate from "Never Played" view
- Possible stat: "X games to revisit"
