TODO
- Need to be able to go to a room and switch characters.
- UI elements stop being centered after a bit and go to the right.
- Ship Life prototype screen doesn't go away. 
- Need a page for inventory
- Need a reason to pick between different missions
    - Possible types of resources
    - Difficulty
    - Unlocks other missions
- Portal room seems off now, like why is it here?
    Eventually, it'll house the load out for what guardians you take and what you bring with you. 
- We ahve the mission path now, but I don't know what missions I need to take for what stuff to unlock.
- Seems like you should have to succeed to unlock the other level of missions. 
- Seems like some missions should go away.Training Exercise
- New missions should be colored different
- Text says victor on mission bar, even if you aren't going to win.
- Be nice to have a mission count
- Better mission color range from 1 - 10. Red at 3 is too much.
- Be able to level missions 
- Almost wish I could see the web of missions and where it leads
