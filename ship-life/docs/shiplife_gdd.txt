# Ship Life Prototype - Game Design Document (GDD)

## Document Information
- **Project**: FellowDivers - Ship Life Prototype
- **Version**: 1.0 - MVP Specification
- **Date**: January 2026
- **Purpose**: Validate long-term meta-game progression loop for "life between missions"

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Goals
Ship Life is a single-player web-based prototype simulating the progression systems that will drive long-term engagement in FellowDivers. The prototype tests:
- **Progression Loop**: Mission → Resources → Crafting → Upgrades → Relationships → New Missions
- **Narrative Engagement**: Whether players care about Guardian characters through conversations
- **Resource Economy**: How many resource types and upgrade paths are needed for depth
- **Content Volume**: How many missions/conversations/items are needed to sustain hours of play

### 1.2 Core Experience
Players inhabit a Guardian (space superhero) aboard a ship between missions. They:
1. Select missions from a Mission Computer
2. Simulate mission outcomes (success/fail, resource rewards)
3. Craft items and upgrade workstations using resources
4. Build relationships with other Guardians through conversations
5. Unlock new missions, conversations, and blueprints as they progress

### 1.3 Key Design Pillars
- **Extensibility**: All content (missions, items, conversations) editable via JSON files
- **Clarity**: Two-state systems (locked/unlocked, can craft/can't craft) avoid confusion
- **Reward Density**: Frequent progression moments (every 1-2 missions unlock something)
- **Narrative Integration**: Progression unlocks story beats, not just mechanical upgrades

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Room System
The ship has distinct rooms, each serving a specific function:

| Room | Function | Interactables |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Landing Page** | Entry point, fullscreen trigger | Play button, Quit button |
| **Character Select** | Choose active Guardian | 4 Guardian portraits |
| **Mission Computer** | Select missions to run | 3 mission cards |
| **Workstations** | Craft items, upgrade stations | 5+ workstation icons |
| **Planetfall Portal** | Launch missions, see results | Launch button, results screen |
| **Observation Deck** | Talk to Guardians | 2-3 Guardian NPCs |
| **Character Room** | Swap active Guardian | All Guardian portraits |
| **Quarters** | View achievements (future) | Trophy displays |

**Navigation**: Persistent bar at top with room names. Current room is highlighted. Navigation locks during conversations, mission selection, and simulation.

**Visual Design**: Each room has a background (image or HEX color), title displayed below nav bar, and ambient music (hooks for future implementation).

---

## 3. Core Systems

### 3.1 Guardian System

#### 3.1.1 Guardian Definition
Guardians are playable characters. Each has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., "stella")
- **Name**: Display name (e.g., "Stella")
- **Portrait**: Image or color placeholder
- **Role**: Tank/DPS/Support (future feature, stub for now)
- **Description**: Character bio

#### 3.1.2 Active Guardian
- One Guardian is always "active" (the player's current character)
- Active Guardian's portrait displays in top-right of screen
- Conversations available depend on active Guardian
- Active Guardian persists across sessions (saved in localStorage)

#### 3.1.3 Guardian Swapping
- Navigate to Character Room to swap Guardians
- Click new Guardian → Becomes active immediately
- Inventory and workstation upgrades are **shared** across all Guardians
- Conversation progress is **per Guardian pair** (Stella's talks with Vawn ≠ Tiberius's talks with Vawn)

#### 3.1.4 Starting Guardians (MVP)
- 4 Guardians available: **Stella, Vawn, Tiberius, Maestra**
- All unlocked from the start
- Future: Locked Guardians (grayed out, unlock via progression)

---

### 3.2 Mission System

#### 3.2.1 Mission Structure
Missions are combat scenarios that generate resources. Each mission has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Display name
- **Description**: Mission brief
- **Map**: World location (visual context)
- **Image**: Mission card artwork (or color placeholder)
- **Difficulty**: 1-10 (affects success rate)
- **Repeatable**: Can mission appear again after completion?
- **Persist on Fail**: Does mission stay in pool if you fail?
- **Prerequisites**: Conditions to unlock (completed missions, flag checks, mission count)
- **Rewards**: Items and quantities (with drop chances)
- **Unlock on Complete**: Missions/flags unlocked after success
- **Simulation Messages**: Text displayed during mission simulation

#### 3.2.2 Mission Computer Display
- Shows **3 mission cards** at a time
- Cards can be: Unlocked (clickable), Locked (grayed out with unlock text), Empty (no missions available)
- Clicking unlocked mission → Navigates to Planetfall Portal with mission selected
- Locked missions show prerequisite text: "Complete First Contact to unlock"

#### 3.2.3 Mission Prerequisites
Missions unlock based on:
- **Specific missions completed**: `"prerequisites": ["first_contact"]`
- **Total mission count**: `"prerequisites": { "total_missions": 5 }`
- **Flags set**: `"prerequisites": { "flags": ["reactor_destroyed"] }`

#### 3.2.4 Mission Selection Pool
- System filters all missions by prerequisites
- Randomly selects up to 3 unlocked missions
- Repeatable missions can reappear after completion
- Non-repeatable missions disappear after completion

#### 3.2.5 Success Rate Calculation
Base success rate = `100 - (difficulty × 10)`
- Difficulty 1 = 90% success
- Difficulty 5 = 50% success
- Difficulty 10 = 10% success

Future: Success rate modified by equipped Aspects, Guardian roles, Anomalies

#### 3.2.6 Mission Rewards
Rewards have:
- **Item ID**: What drops
- **Min/Max Amount**: Random quantity range
- **Drop Chance**: Percentage chance to drop (0-100)

System rolls each reward independently:
1. Roll drop chance (e.g., 30% for Rare Alloy)
2. If successful, roll quantity (min 1, max 3)
3. Add to player inventory

Multiple entries of same item can stack (roll twice, get 2 drops).

Failure gives reduced rewards (typically 25% of success rewards).

---

### 3.3 Mission Simulation System

#### 3.3.1 Simulation Flow
1. Player clicks "Launch Mission" in Planetfall Portal
2. Navigation locks (can't leave room)
3. Loading bar appears (0% → 100%)

    { "text": "Vawn is taking heavy fire!", "bar_progress": 50, "display_time": 3 }
  ]
}
```
- **text**: Message displayed
- **bar_progress**: Loading bar target percentage
- **display_time**: Seconds to show message

Total simulation time = sum of all display_times.

#### 3.3.3 Cancel Button
- Appears 3 seconds into simulation
- Fades in smoothly
- Clicking skips to Mission Results immediately
- Available to all players (not just debug)

#### 3.3.4 Mission Results Screen

- Clicking opens sidebar with recipe list

#### 3.5.3 Recipe List (Left Side)
- Upgrade option at top (if not max level)
- All recipes below, sorted by level requirement
- Each recipe shows: Icon, Name
- **Two visual states**:
  - Normal (can craft): Full color, clickable
  - Grayed out (can't craft): 50% opacity, not clickable

Recipes grayed out if:
- Missing resources
- Workstation level too low
- Missing blueprint

#### 3.5.4 Recipe Sidebar (Right Side)
Clicking recipe in list shows details:
- **Name**: Recipe name
- **Description**: What it does
- **Requirements**: Workstation level, blueprint, resources
- **Resource counts**: Format `Plasma Core (1/3)` - current in red if insufficient
- **Craft button**: Grayed out if requirements not met

#### 3.5.5 Crafting Process
1. Player clicks recipe in list
2. Sidebar shows requirements
3. Player clicks "Craft" button (if enabled)
4. System checks resources
5. Deduct resources from inventory
6. Add crafted item to inventory
7. Update sidebar (resources refresh)
8. Auto-save

#### 3.5.6 Workstation Upgrades
- Upgrade displayed as first item in recipe list
- Shows required resources with X/Y counts
- Clicking shows sidebar with upgrade details
- Upgrading:
  - Deducts resources
  - Increments workstation level
  - Removes old upgrade from list (shows next tier or "MAX LEVEL")
  - Unlocks new recipes (grayed out recipes become normal if blueprint owned)

#### 3.5.7 Workstation Progression
- All recipes persist across levels (Level 1 recipes still visible at Level 3)
- New recipes unlock at higher levels
- Recipes require BOTH workstation level AND blueprint (if applicable)

---

### 3.6 Blueprint System

#### 3.6.1 Blueprint Flow
1. Player loots blueprint from mission → Added to inventory
2. Player navigates to Workshop → Opens Knowledge Base workstation
3. Knowledge Base shows two columns:
   - **Left**: Blueprints in inventory (not yet learned)
   - **Right**: Blueprints already learned (archived)
4. Click "Upload Blueprints" button
5. All blueprints in inventory → Move to learned column
6. Recipes unlock in relevant workstations
7. Blueprints stay in Knowledge Base forever (collection tracker)

#### 3.6.2 Starting Blueprints
- Some blueprints flagged `unlocked_at_start: true` in Blueprints.json
- On first load, system adds these to learned_blueprints automatically
- Provides starter recipes without grinding

#### 3.6.3 Blueprint-Recipe Relationship
Each blueprint has `unlocks_recipe: "recipe_id"` field.
When blueprint learned, recipes with matching ID become visible in workstations (if workstation level sufficient).

---

### 3.7 Conversation System

#### 3.7.1 Conversation Structure
Conversations are narrative vignettes between Guardians. Each has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Priority**: Important or Background
- **Repeatable**: Can conversation play multiple times?
- **Player Char Req**: Which Guardian(s) can trigger ("stella", ["stella", "vawn"], or "any")

- **Actor2**: Second Guardian in conversation (right portrait)
- **Prerequisites**: Conditions to unlock
- **Lines**: Sequence of dialogue
- **On Complete**: Flags set, relationship changes

#### 3.7.2 Conversation Lines
Each line has:
- **Speaker**: Guardian ID ("stella", "vawn")
- **Text**: Dialogue text
- **Portrait**: Image for that line (can change per line for expressions)

Speakers can be any Guardian, not limited to actor1/actor2 (allows 3+ person conversations or overheard dialogue).

#### 3.7.3 Observation Deck Display
- Shows 2-3 Guardians (configurable via Rooms.json)
- Guardians selected based on:
  1. Has Important conversation with active Guardian → Prioritized
  2. Has Background conversation with active Guardian → Lower priority
  3. Random selection if multiple eligible
- Does not show active Guardian (can't talk to yourself)
- Does not show duplicate Guardians (if "stella" is in specific slot, don't add her to eligible pool)

#### 3.7.4 Conversation Trigger Flow
1. Player clicks Guardian in Observation Deck
2. System shows list of available conversations:
   - All Important conversations (titles visible)
   - 1 Background conversation (filler)
3. Player selects conversation
4. Conversation UI opens (locks navigation)
5. Display actor1 portrait (left), actor2 portrait (right)
6. Show lines sequentially:
   - Speaker's portrait highlighted
   - Text types out (typewriter effect placeholder)
   - Player clicks "Next" to advance
7. After final line, return to Observation Deck
8. Mark conversation as completed, set flags, increment relationship

#### 3.7.5 Conversation Prerequisites
Conversations unlock based on:
- **Missions together**: `"missions_together": { "stella_vawn": 6 }`
- **Total missions**: `"total_missions": 10`
- **Previous conversation**: `"previous_convo": "STELLA_VAWN_001"`
- **Flags**: `"flags": ["reactor_destroyed"]`

Prerequisites use AND logic (all conditions must be met).

#### 3.7.6 Relationship Tracking
System tracks per-Guardian-pair:
- **Missions together**: Integer count (increments when both on same mission)
- **Conversations completed**: Integer count (increments after conversation)

Data structure in save file:
```json
"relationships": {
  "missions_together": {
    "vawn_stella": 6,
    "vawn_tiberius": 3
  },
  "conversations_completed": {
    "vawn_stella": 3
  }
}
```

Pairs auto-generate keys (alphabetical: "stella_vawn" not "vawn_stella").

#### 3.7.7 Important vs Background Priority
- **Important**: Story-critical, character development, unlocks content
- **Background**: Flavor, repeatable, filler when no Important conversations available

Important conversations push Guardians to appear in Observation Deck. If multiple Guardians have Important conversations, system randomly selects among them.

#### 3.7.8 Repeatable Conversations
Background conversations can be marked `repeatable: true`. These replay if Guardian has no other conversations available (prevents empty Observation Deck).

---

### 3.8 State Management (Blackboard System)

#### 3.8.1 Purpose
Central state manager tracks all player progress:
- Active Guardian
- Last room visited
- Inventory (items + quantities)
- Workstation levels
- Learned blueprints
- Completed missions
- Mission counters (total, per-Guardian, per-pair)
- Completed conversations
- Relationship counts
- Custom flags

#### 3.8.2 Save System
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Format**: JSON
- **Trigger**: Auto-save after every action (mission complete, craft item, finish conversation, upgrade workstation)
- **Persistence**: State survives browser close/reopen
- **Corruption Handling**: If save corrupted, show error and reset to fresh state

#### 3.8.3 State Structure (Example)
```json
{
  "active_guardian": "stella",
  "last_room": "mission_computer",
  "inventory": {
    "plasma_cell": 47,
    "common_alloy": 23
  },
  "workstations": {
    "weapons_bench": { "level": 2 }
  },
  "learned_blueprints": ["blueprint_basic_rifle"],
  "completed_missions": ["first_contact", "supply_run"],
  "mission_counters": {
    "total": 15,
    "stella": 8,
    "vawn": 10
  },
  "relationships": {
    "missions_together": { "vawn_stella": 6 }
  },
  "flags": {
    "first_contact_complete": true,
    "reactor_destroyed": false
  }
}
```

#### 3.8.4 First Load Behavior
If no save file exists:
1. Create blank state
2. Add starting blueprints (flagged `unlocked_at_start: true`)
3. Set default values (empty inventory, all workstations Level 1)
4. Force Character Select (no active Guardian)
5. Save state

---

### 3.9 Navigation & Room System
