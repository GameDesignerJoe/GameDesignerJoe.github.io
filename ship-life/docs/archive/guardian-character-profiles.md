Guardian Character Profiles
Stella - Sun-Powered Warrior Princess
Stella wields the power of the Concordance Orrery through mystical tattoos covering her body, manifesting as a solar-energy spear and shield that make her a battlefield commander. She's great at protecting allies and holding defensive positions, good at offensive strikes and tactical leadership, okay at ranged combat, bad at stealth operations, and horrible at retreating or abandoning those in need. Her sun-powered abilities drain in prolonged darkness, and her optimistic nature can make her underestimate threats.

Vawn - God-Powered Gunslinger
Vawn's natural piloting skills and duelist reflexes are augmented by the Hands of Astarte—powerful cybernetic weapons fused to his body by the machine goddess herself. He's great at ranged precision shooting and navigation, good at quick-draw duels and starship piloting, okay at hand-to-hand combat, bad at heavy armor engagements, and horrible at ignoring injustice when he sees it. His reputation as "the luckiest man in the galaxy" sometimes leads him to take unnecessary risks.

Tiberius - Avatar of Winter
Tiberius hosts the Heart of Winter, an ancient Esri guardian deity that grants him ice-based powers and has extended his life for over two centuries. He's great at tactical battlefield command and defensive ice constructs, good at inspiring allies and close-quarters combat, okay at adapting to chaotic situations, bad at compromising his principles, and horrible at knowing when to rest or step back from leadership. The Heart of Winter can sometimes push him to demand too much from himself and others.

Maestra - Cosmic Magical Girl
Maestra is an Astromagi—a living construct of starstuff created to maintain the Concordance Orrery—giving her phenomenal cosmic powers and ancient knowledge. She's great at large-scale magical manipulation and stellar navigation, good at energy projection and understanding arcane systems, okay at personal combat, bad at understanding mortal social dynamics, and horrible at finding purpose without a clear directive. Her cheerful demeanor masks an existential search for meaning after abandoning her original purpose.

Nyx - Dragonslayer
Nyx wields the Askalon Rail, a unique arcanotech weapon forged from St. George's dragon-slaying lance that can wound even Elder Dragons—but only if wielded with absolute courage and conviction. She's great at anti-Dragonkin combat and special operations, good at tactical assault and weapons expertise, okay at diplomacy when it serves her mission, bad at trusting former enemies, and horrible at accepting compromise with imperial forces. The Askalon Rail demands she purge fear from her heart each time she fires it, and her zealous conviction can blind her to nuance.

Shadow - Clinical Cyborg Assassin
Shadow is a highly augmented cyborg assassin whose body has been extensively modified with technology that enhances her combat capabilities and sensory processing. She's great at stealth kills and infiltration, good at data analysis and target tracking, okay at sustained firefights, bad at empathetic connections, and horrible at improvisation when missions go off-script. Her cybernetic enhancements give her cold precision but have dulled her emotional responses, making her clinical and detached even from her own Dragonkin heritage.
