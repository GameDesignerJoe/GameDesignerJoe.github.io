Playback ToDo
Priority 1:
- STILL BROKE: Dropbox links aren't refreshing and images are still not showing up. 
- Need to do an auto refresh of your home folder whenever you add a source.

Priority 2: 
- Get google drive to work with it.
- The amount of stacked alerts when you add songs is a bit much. 
- The back arrow and ... right above and below the song list is odd.
- Pictures for playlists
- : button on songs doesn't scroll with the window so if you're trying to better see the options in the menu, you can't
- Need to update the very first page
- We don't show duration
- Get the play button on the numbers thing working.
- Get all songs to have a number count.
- Move the play button over to the numbers. 
- Get durations on songs.
- Look into ID3 tags on your songs, or at least some of them so you can start seeing what that looks like. 
- Get album art for playlists to show up in side bar, as well as the 'add to playtest menu

Priority 3:
Can we get the 'add to playlist' list to also show the gradienat circles.
- Consider view modes for the library (big grid, small grid, list, details, etc)
- get rid of those ugly buttons
- Look at Jason's example for UI layout
- Make a playlist with a song from each source to test
- Do a more Spotify pass on it 
- Get a logo 
- Do we really need a scrollbar on the PC version. Maybe we can dress it up so it's not so ugly.
- The plus button is out of alignment with the circle.
- how we're displaying these songs is not ideal - need more that that to go on. 
- I would like a list of total song count
- Would be nice to know the path that each of the songs are coming from at some point if we can do it and make it look nice. 
- Thought about puting a little icon onthe far right of every song to show its source icon.
- Need to make the favicon white instead of black.
- There's a cue that is odd and hard to get to. Need to look at a new design for that (look at what spotify does). You get to it on mobile by pressing the hamburger and then minimizing the now playing. 
- Need a better cassette tape icon
- Make it so you can add your on image to the playlist art. 

MOBILE:
- Mobile: Player clips the bottom of the buttons. 
- Mobile: Sources sidebar looks like crap. Consider running it along the top.Removing the text and just having the icon. 
- Mobile: The next song doesn't play if the phone is closed and the screen is black. Actually, it thinks it's playing, I just can't hear anything. I look down and see that the song is 15 seconds in, but no audio comes out. Then if I click on the module it opens up my phone and starts playing... However, it's brought up a different, non-music app of mine. If i close that app, the music stops, despite the music app still being open. 
- Mobile: Add a small play button next to the folder, just to the left of the text. If you press that it plays the folder without having to go into the playlist. 
- Mobile: I'm still not getting the < > on the song module. I'm just getting the skip ahead 10 seconds.
