Playback ToDo
Priority 1:
- STILL BROKE: Dropbox links aren't refreshing and images are still not showing up. 
- Get google drive to work with it.


Priority 2: 
- The amoung stacked alerts when you add songs is a bit much. 
- The back arrow and ... right above and below the song list is odd.

Priority 3:
- get rid of those ugly buttons
- Look at Jason's example for UI layout
- Make a playlist with a song from each source to test
- Do a more Spotify pass on it 
- Get a logo 
- Do we really need a scrollbar on the PC version. Maybe we can dress it up so it's not so ugly.
- The plus button is out of alignment with the circle.
- how we're displaying these songs is not ideal. 
- I would like a list of total song count
- Would be nice to know the path that each of the songs are coming from at some point if we can do it and make it look nice. 
- Can't select a song, press control or shift and select another song and have it select all of them. 
- Check for duplicate songs and tell the user "You've already got this song in there. Add?"
- Show what song is playing and make it green or purple.
- Need to make the favicon white instead of black.
- Repeat icon needs to show if it's on, all, or one. It's there, but it's tiny. 
- Pictures for songs. We're going to want them. Need to figure out how. 
- Pictures for playlists
- Swap the Songs/Artists/Albums with the search option. Not really a fan of the search this way, might just want to have something off to the side that pops out.
- The Library page needs a ui refresh.
- Need to do an auto refresh of your home folder whenever you add a source.
- Mobile: Player clips the bottom of the buttons. 
- Mobile: Sources sidebar looks like crap. Consider running it along the top.Removing the text and just having the icon. 
- Mobile: The next song doesn't play if the phone is closed and the screen is black. Actually, it thinks it's playing, I just can't hear anything. I look down and see that the song is 15 seconds in, but no audio comes out. Then if I click on the module it opens up my phone and starts playing... However, it's brought up a different, non-music app of mine. If i close that app, the music stops, despite the music app still being open. 
- Mobile: Add a small play button next to the folder, just to the left of the text. If you press that it plays the folder without having to go into the playlist. 
- Mobile: I'm still not getting the < > on the song module. I'm just getting the skip ahead 10 seconds.
- ID3 tagging within the app? Is that possible?
- Need simple back arrow navigation when it comes to going in and out of the folders.
- There's a cue that is odd and hard to get to. Need to look at a new design for that (look at what spotify does). You get to it on mobile by pressing the hamburger and then minimizing the now playing. 
- Need a better cassette tape icon
- I think playlists should showup on the main page. Perhaps they are circles instead of squares, or maybe it just doesn't matter. 
- Let lines wordwrap
