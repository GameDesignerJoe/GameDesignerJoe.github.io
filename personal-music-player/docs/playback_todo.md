Playback ToDo
Priority 1:
- Need to do an auto refresh of your home folder whenever you add a source.
- There's a scan button on the source drive folder that seems to not be doing things we want. 
- Don't support custom order on Folders
- It's showing the same track in two different playlists as being paused, rather than just the instance of the one you clicked.

Priority 2: 
- Add image replacement for cover art.
- Get google drive to work with it.
- The amount of stacked alerts when you add songs is a bit much. 
- Need to update the very first page
- Removing folders from a source isn't great. You have to click it and then it takes you back to library. So if you want to do more than one, you have to keep clicking back to the source you want. A 'disconnect all' for each source buton isn't a bad idea. 
- Lyrics... lyrics
- Remove New folder from the Home Page
- Hover text on source icon shows you the path. Would be nice if it would show the full path for dropbox as well.
- You have a playlist page that is odd and should likely go away.
- Add a toggle for playlist versions

Priority 3:
- get rid of those ugly buttons
- Look at Jason's example for UI layout. See how you can turn up the 'visual celebration of the art'.
- Get a logo 
- Do we really need a scrollbar on the PC version. Maybe we can dress it up so it's not so ugly.
- The plus button is out of alignment with the circle.
- I would like a list of total song count
- Would be nice to know the path that each of the songs are coming from at some point if we can do it and make it look nice. 
- Thought about puting a little icon onthe far right of every song to show its source icon.
- Need to make the favicon white instead of black.
- There's a cue that is odd and hard to get to. Need to look at a new design for that (look at what spotify does). You get to it on mobile by pressing the hamburger and then minimizing the now playing. 
- Need a better cassette tape icon
- Make it so you can add your on image to the playlist art. 

MOBILE:
- Mobile: Player clips the bottom of the buttons. 
- Mobile: Sources sidebar looks like crap. Consider running it along the top.Removing the text and just having the icon. 
- Mobile: The next song doesn't play if the phone is closed and the screen is black. Actually, it thinks it's playing, I just can't hear anything. I look down and see that the song is 15 seconds in, but no audio comes out. Then if I click on the module it opens up my phone and starts playing... However, it's brought up a different, non-music app of mine. If i close that app, the music stops, despite the music app still being open. 
- Mobile: Add a small play button next to the folder, just to the left of the text. If you press that it plays the folder without having to go into the playlist. 
- Mobile: I'm still not getting the < > on the song module. I'm just getting the skip ahead 10 seconds.
