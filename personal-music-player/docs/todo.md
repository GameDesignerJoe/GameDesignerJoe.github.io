Playback ToDo
- Improve the folder add option to be it's own thing.
- Get it to show songs as well as folders
- Have clicking on a folder go into the folder on double click
- get rid of those ugly buttons
- Look at Jason's example
- Get it to add songs as well as folders
- Get google drive to work with it.
- Get it to work with songs on your hard drive
- Make a playlist with a song from each
- Do a more Spotify pass on it 
- Get a logo
- Get deployments to work for Vercel again. Did I fix it? maybe?
- Get the faviicon to be white.
- When you select add songs, it still goes to the old folder add system. 
- When music is playing the music bar cuts into where you can see folders. 
- I think we can remove the preview window from Sources
- The plus button is out of alignment with the circle.
- Add a 'add folder' "+" to the top of the file structure when you're looking at a group of songs. 
- The amoung stacked alerts when you add songs is a bit much. 
- how we're displaying these songs is not ideal. 
- Need some default abstract images for placeholder songs
- I would expect to see Pluses selected on sub folders.
- I would like a list of total song count
- When looking at the play track bar at the bottom. It only has pause, not the rest of the mechanics we want (next, previous, shuffle, etc.)
- Would be nice to know the path that each of the songs are coming from at some point if we can do it and make it look nice. 
- We might need a 'home page' 
- Can't select a song, press control or shift and select another song and have it select all of them. 
- Check for duplicate songs
- Show what song is playing.
