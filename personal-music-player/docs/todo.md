Playback ToDo
- Improve the folder add option to be it's own thing.
- Get it to show songs as well as folders
- Have clicking on a folder go into the folder on double click
- get rid of those ugly buttons
- Look at Jason's example
- Get it to add songs as well as folders
- Get google drive to work with it.
- Get it to work with songs on your hard drive
- Make a playlist with a song from each
- Do a more Spotify pass on it 
- Get a logo
- Get deployments to work for Vercel again. Did I fix it? maybe?
- Get the faviicon to be white.
- When you select add songs, it still goes to the old folder add system. 
- When music is playing the music bar cuts into where you can see folders. 
- I think we can remove the preview window from Sources
- The plus button is out of alignment with the circle.
- Add a 'add folder' "+" to the top of the file structure when you're looking at a group of songs. 
- The amoung stacked alerts when you add songs is a bit much. 
- how we're displaying these songs is not ideal. 
- Need some default abstract images for placeholder songs
- I would expect to see Pluses selected on sub folders.
- I would like a list of total song count
- When looking at the play track bar at the bottom. It only has pause, not the rest of the mechanics we want (next, previous, shuffle, etc.)
- Would be nice to know the path that each of the songs are coming from at some point if we can do it and make it look nice. 
- We might need a 'home page' 
- Can't select a song, press control or shift and select another song and have it select all of them. 
- Check for duplicate songs
- Show what song is playing.
- When you are playing a 'filtered' song from the folder, it doens't play the next song in the filter, but the next song in the overall list. Day 7 went to Day 8, not Day 14.
- Need to make the song cassette image white instead of black. 
- Need to rename My Playback to just PLAYBACK in caps
- Need to make the favicon white instead of black.
- Repeat icon needs to show if it's on, all, or one.
- Pictures for songs
- Pictures for playlists
- Add a play button right on top of the folders so you can just click play in there without having to drill into the folder (Spotify)
- Swap the Songs/Artists/Albums with the search option. Not really a fan of the search this way, might just want to have something off to the side that pops out.
- Need to do an auto refresh of your home folder whenever you add a source.
- Mobile: Player clips the bottom of the buttons. 
- Mobile: Sources sidebar looks like crap. Consider running it along the top.Removing the text and just having the icon.
