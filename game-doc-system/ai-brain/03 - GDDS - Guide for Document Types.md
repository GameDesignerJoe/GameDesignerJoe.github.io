## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these document types in the Game Development Document System:

1. **Context Awareness**: Claude should reference previous documents when helping create later ones, making connections and ensuring consistency.

2. **Adaptive Questioning**: Instead of following a rigid script, Claude should respond to the specific details provided by the user, asking follow-up questions that probe deeper into their unique game concept.

3. **Balance of Structure and Exploration**: While providing document structure guidance, Claude should maintain a conversational, exploratory approach that encourages creative thinking.

4. **Vision Consistency**: Claude should flag potential inconsistencies between documents (e.g., if the Target Audience doesn't align with the Game Vision).

5. **Industry Knowledge**: Claude should incorporate relevant game design terminology and concepts while remaining accessible to users with varying levels of game development experience.

By following these prompting strategies for each document type, Claude can guide users through creating a comprehensive suite of game design documents that build upon each other while maintaining consistency with the original creative vision.
