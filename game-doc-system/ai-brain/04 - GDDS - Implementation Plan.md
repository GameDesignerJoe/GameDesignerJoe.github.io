   - Save/sync documents to cloud storage
   - Share documents via Drive

3. **Improved Capture & Intelligence** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Better document content extraction from Claude conversations
   - Smarter detection of document completion
   - Content validation and suggestion features

4. **Enhanced UI/UX** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Improved document creation wizard
   - Visual styling enhancements
   - Onboarding experience
   - Keyboard shortcuts and productivity features

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish

**Goal:** Add advanced capabilities and prepare for wider distribution.

**Timeline:** 12 weeks after Phase 2

### Phase 3 Features

1. **Document Versioning & History** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Track document versions
   - Compare and restore previous versions
   - Document change logs

2. **Export Enhancements** (Weeks 4-6)
   - Multiple export formats (HTML, Google Docs, etc.)
   - Custom styling and formatting options
   - Batch export capabilities

3. **Collaboration Features** (Weeks 7-9)
   - Share projects with team members
   - Comment and feedback system
   - Real-time updates and notifications

4. **Advanced Document Analysis** (Weeks 10-12)
   - Consistency checking across documents
   - Project health assessment
   - Suggestions for improvement
   - Document quality metrics

## Tracking & Management

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Development Progress**
   - Features completed vs. planned
   - Bug count and resolution rate
   - Test coverage

2. **User Metrics** (Post-MVP)
   - Number of active users
   - Documents created per user
   - Completion rate of document suites
   - Export frequency

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Extension load time
   - Response time for key actions
   - Storage usage

### Implementation Checklist - MVP

- [ ] **Setup Development Environment**
  - [ ] Initialize project with TypeScript, Webpack
  - [ ] Create Chrome extension manifest
  - [ ] Setup GitHub repository with CI/CD

- [ ] **Core Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Implement storage manager
  - [ ] Create document type definitions
  - [ ] Setup message passing between components

- [ ] **UI Components**
  - [ ] Design and implement sidebar UI
  - [ ] Create project management interface
  - [ ] Build document creation flow
  - [ ] Implement document viewing interface

- [ ] **Claude Integration**
  - [ ] Build context injection system
  - [ ] Create response monitoring and capture
  - [ ] Implement document content extraction

- [ ] **Testing & Deployment**
  - [ ] Create automated tests
  - [ ] Perform manual testing on Claude.ai
  - [ ] Package for distribution
  - [ ] Create installation guide

### Risk Assessment

1. **Technical Risks**
   - **Claude.ai DOM Changes:** Continuous monitoring and quick updates if Claude's interface changes
   - **Storage Limitations:** Plan for efficient storage and implement cloud sync early if needed
   - **Context Window Limitations:** Optimize prompt size and document context sharing

2. **User Experience Risks**
   - **Learning Curve:** Focus on intuitive design and clear onboarding
   - **Workflow Disruption:** Ensure extension enhances rather than interrupts the conversation flow
   - **Content Extraction Accuracy:** Develop robust algorithms for identifying document content

3. **Business Risks**
   - **Chrome Extensions Policy Changes:** Monitor updates to Chrome Web Store policies
   - **Claude API Changes:** Build flexible integration that can adapt to API updates
   - **Similar Product Competition:** Focus on unique features and superior UX

## Resources Required

1. **Development Team**
   - 1 Frontend Developer (Chrome extension, UI)
   - 1 Backend Developer (storage, Google Drive integration)
   - 1 Game Design Consultant (document structure and prompts)

2. **Testing Resources**
   - Small group of game developers for beta testing
   - QA testing for extension functionality

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Chrome Developer Account
   - Google Cloud Platform (for Drive API)
   - GitHub repository
   - Testing devices

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. Users can successfully create, view, and export at least 3 document types
2. Document content is accurately captured from Claude conversations
3. Projects and documents are correctly saved and retrievable
4. The extension works reliably across Chrome versions
5. Initial user feedback indicates value and improved workflow

## Next Steps To Begin Implementation

1. **Immediate (Next 1-2 days)**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Setup development environment
   - Create initial project structure

2. **Short-term (First week)**
   - Implement basic DOM injection for sidebar
   - Create storage infrastructure
   - Begin UI component development

3. **Medium-term (First 2 weeks)**
   - Complete basic document creation flow for Game Vision
   - Implement Claude context injection
   - Test document storage and retrieval
