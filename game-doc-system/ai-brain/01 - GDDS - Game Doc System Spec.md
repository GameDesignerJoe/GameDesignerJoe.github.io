# Game Development Document System - Comprehensive Specification

**Project Documentation: Part 1 of 2**

## 1. System Overview

The Game Development Document System (GDDS) is a Chrome extension that enhances Claude.ai with specialized functionality for creating a comprehensive suite of game development documents. The system leverages Claude's conversational AI capabilities to guide users through an adaptive questioning process that builds each document iteratively, with each document informing the creation of subsequent documents.

## 2. Core Document Types

The system supports the following document types, typically created in this sequence:

1. **Game Vision** - High-level concept and creative direction
2. **Core Game Concept** - Fundamental gameplay and experience definition
3. **Target Audience** - Detailed analysis of intended players
4. **Core Pillars and Values** - Guiding principles and design values
5. **Why Would They Play It?** - Player motivations and retention hooks
6. **What Should They Feel?** - Emotional experience and player impact
7. **Unique Selling Points** - Distinctive features and market differentiation
8. **Game Loop** - Core gameplay cycle and mechanics
9. **Player Journey** - Player progression and experience arc
10. **Story Overview** - Narrative foundation and thematic elements
11. **Presentation** - How the game will be shown/marketed
12. **Key Questions** - Critical design and development considerations
13. **Core Design Details** - Specific systems and design specifications
14. **Strategic Direction** - Business and development strategy

Each document has a specific purpose and structure but is created through a dynamic conversation rather than a fixed template.

## 3. User Experience Flow

### 3.1 Project Management

1. **Chrome Extension Installation**
   - User installs extension from Chrome Web Store
   - Extension adds a collapsible sidebar to Claude.ai interface

2. **Project List View**
   - Sidebar shows folders for each game project
   - "Start New Project" button at the top
   - Each project folder expands to show document list

3. **Document List View**
   - Completed documents shown with full name and icons for actions:
     - üìÑ (view document)
     - üîÑ (refine document)
     - ‚¨áÔ∏è (export document)
   - Pending documents shown in gray with a "+" button to initiate creation
   - Documents in-progress shown with a progress indicator

### 3.2 Document Creation Flow

1. **Initiation**
   - User clicks "+" on a document from the list
   - System prepares Claude with specialized context for that document type
   - If this isn't the first document, system provides Claude with content from prior documents

2. **Guided Conversation**
   - Claude begins with an open-ended prompt about the document topic
   - Based on user responses, Claude asks targeted follow-up questions
   - Questions adapt to previous answers, exploring different aspects
   - The conversation follows Claude's natural questioning style, not preset questions

3. **Document Drafting**
   - Once sufficient information is gathered, Claude drafts the document
   - User reviews the draft and can request changes
   - Claude refines based on feedback
   - Process continues until user is satisfied

4. **Document Finalization**
   - User approves the final version
   - System stores the document in the project folder
   - Document becomes available for reference in creating subsequent documents

### 3.3 Document Refinement

1. **Access**
   - User clicks the "refine" icon on a completed document
   - System loads document content and prepares Claude with context

2. **Refinement Process**
   - Claude presents the current document with options for refinement
   - User specifies desired changes or improvements
   - Claude updates the document based on feedback
   - Changes are saved to the document

### 3.4 Document Export

1. **Export Options**
   - PDF Export (for sharing and printing)
   - Google Drive Export (for collaborative editing)
   - Markdown Export (for technical documentation)
   - Plain Text Export (for maximum compatibility)

2. **Export Process**
   - User clicks export icon on a document
   - System presents export format options
   - User selects desired format
   - System generates file and initiates download
   - Option to save to connected cloud storage

## 5. AI Prompting Framework

### 5.1 Document-Specific Context

For each document type, Claude needs specific context about:

1. **Document Purpose** - What this document aims to accomplish
2. **Typical Content** - Key elements usually found in this document
3. **Relationship to Other Documents** - How it builds on or informs other docs
4. **Target Audience** - Who will read/use this document

### 5.2 Question Generation Guidance

Claude should be guided to:

1. Begin with open-ended questions about the document topic
2. Follow up with specific questions based on user responses
3. Explore multiple aspects of the topic (creative, technical, business)
4. Reference content from previous documents when relevant
5. Identify inconsistencies or gaps in the game concept
6. Help users think more deeply about their game vision

### 5.3 Document Context Examples

Here are examples of the context provided to Claude for each document type:

**Game Vision Document Context:**
```
You are helping create a Game Vision document. This is the foundational document that captures the creative essence and high-level concept of the game. Ask open-ended questions to understand what makes this game special, its core experience, and the creator's inspiration. Focus on emotional impact, unique selling points, and creative direction. This document will inform all subsequent design decisions.
```

**Core Game Concept Context:**
```
You are helping create a Core Game Concept document. Building on the Game Vision, this document defines the fundamental gameplay experience. Ask questions about core mechanics, player actions, world/setting details, and how these elements deliver on the vision. Focus on what players actually do in the game and how it feels to play.
```

**Target Audience Context:**
```
You are helping create a Target Audience document. Using information from the Vision and Core Concept, explore who this game is designed for. Ask questions about demographic factors, player preferences, gaming habits, and why this audience would be attracted to this game. Focus on creating specific player personas and understanding their motivations.
```

(Additional document contexts would follow similar patterns)

  // Find Claude's input field
  const inputField = document.querySelector('.claude-input-field');
  if (inputField) {
    // Set the value
    inputField.value = context;
    
    // Dispatch an input event to make sure Claude recognizes it
    inputField.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
    
    // Submit the form
    const submitButton = document.querySelector('.claude-submit-button');
    if (submitButton) {
      submitButton.click();
    }
  }
}

## 16. Closing Notes

This specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing the Game Development Document System as a Chrome extension that enhances Claude.ai. The system leverages Claude's natural conversational abilities while adding structured document management capabilities.

The implementation should prioritize maintaining the quality of Claude's dynamic questioning process while adding value through organization, persistence, and document management features.

By following this specification, developers should be able to create a system that significantly streamlines the game development documentation process while maintaining the creative benefits of AI-assisted document creation.
