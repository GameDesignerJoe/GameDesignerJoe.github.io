# Sample Game Idea Write-ups

## Technical Sample (Lacking Emotion)

My game concept is a procedurally generated resource management simulation with roguelike elements. The player manages a space station with multiple interconnected systems operating on a tick-based economy. Primary mechanics include oxygen distribution networks, power grid management, and crew assignment algorithms. The station features modular expansion capabilities with 24 distinct module types, each requiring specific resource allocation coefficients. Random events occur based on a weighted probability table that scales with difficulty progression. Player success is measured via multiple quantifiable metrics including resource efficiency, station expansion rate, and survival duration. The target platform is PC with a minimum spec of 8GB RAM and GTX 1060 equivalent GPU. UI will be primarily mouse-driven with keyboard shortcuts for advanced functionality. The game utilizes a custom-built entity component system architecture for optimal performance when handling large numbers of interacting variables.

## Scattered Sample (Child-like)

Ok so my game idea is SUPER COOL it's called MONSTER FRIENDS and you get to have these monsters that follow you around everywhere! And they're cute but also they can be REALLY scary when they fight! And you can collect like a HUNDRED monsters maybe even MORE and they all do different things like some breathe fire and some can fly and some can go underwater and you can dress them up in hats and stuff! And you travel around this world that has like snowy places and desert places and a big volcano and there's bad guys trying to steal all the monster eggs! Oh and the monsters can evolve and get bigger and cooler looking if you feed them special candy! And there's tournaments where you battle other monster trainers and if you win you get cool prizes like rare monsters or magic items! And maybe you could play with friends and trade monsters too! It's going to be the BEST GAME EVER!!!

## Thoughtful Sample (Balanced Gameplay and Emotion)

My game "Echoes of Solace" is an atmospheric adventure where players assume the role of Maya, a hospice nurse who discovers she can momentarily enter the fading memories of her patients. The core gameplay revolves around gentle exploration of these memory fragments, solving environmental puzzles that represent the patient's unresolved emotions or unfinished business. As players piece together each patient's story, they make meaningful choices about how to help them find peaceâ€”whether reconnecting them with estranged loved ones, helping them accept regrets, or celebrating forgotten joys. The art style blends watercolor aesthetics with magical realism, while the soundscape uses dynamic audio that responds to emotional tones within each memory. I want players to experience both melancholy and hope, creating poignant moments that encourage reflection on mortality, memory, and the human connections that sustain us. The gameplay prioritizes emotional resonance over challenge, with the reward being the profound impact Maya has on her patients' final days and the growth she experiences through their shared stories.
