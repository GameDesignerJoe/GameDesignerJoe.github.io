To Do:

Bugs/Tweaks:

Features:

Possible Ideas:
- See about a 'picture of the day' that pulls from some website somewhere, and people can download the image to use that for a puzzle. 
    I looked at Unsplash and even made an account. However, it says I need to keep the API key hidden so, I'd have to move it all over to Vercel and I don't really care enough to do that. 
- Add a preview of the completed picture
- See about going to hex shapes and allowing a tap to rotate the piece. 
- Might as well see about strange puzzle shapes while you're at it.
