To Do:

BALANCE:
- Need a balance pass milestone.
- Passives should slowly regen your game.
- Game costs are off by a factor of 10. 
- Need to test at some point that you have actually unlocked a game by playing it. 

BUGS:
- ✅ DONE - On a new game, it selects a starting line up, then instantly changes it to something else for some reason. 
- ✅ DONE - Remove the 'cancel' option from the draw card. Once you draw, you draw, no going back.
- ✅ DONE - I Shouldn't be able to click on games that are drained and get them to move. In fact, clicking on a drained game in the Game Library should automatically take you to the Key Game Tab. 
- ✅ DONE - I don't like the count numbers for Game Library and Key Games. We should remove them.
- ✅ DONE - I wish it didn't look like tabs, but tha'ts a minor thing.
- ✅ DONE - Passives slowly regenerate drained games. Once 20% refilled, games become clickable again.
- ✅ DONE - Where the Collection points is locatedis too far away. It needs to beright next to or above the game itself.
- ✅ DONE - The Liberation Key cound needs to be bigger. 
- Need to rename this damn game 
- Lots of images aren't being displayed correctly, likey because Steam is bouncing you. 
- ✅ DONE - Need a way to put the name of the game as a placeholder for the image.
- ✅ DONE - Click to Play text still appears on the game when it's drained. This is when the game is in the 'play' area.
- ✅ DONE - Remove the "Liberation" text from anywhere in the game. I'm moving away from that concept.
- Going to need a way to 'recheck' for images because I think we can get more, but steam is timing us out.

FEATURES: 
- ✅ DONE - Clicking on a locked slot in the shop when you don't have keys should make the Key Games tab active.
- We need to add in a place where you can out in your SteamID to get this whole thing started. 
- We need to make our own celebration screens rather than doing the 'localhost' screens. 
- I think we need a Games Played tab that shows the new games you've played since you started playing this game. It's like a trophy case that shows the games you started playing. You can't click on them or anything because it's just a display, but it shows what you've unlocked and maybe how many hours you've spent on it. 
- Maybe only show like 20 unplayed games in the Key Games section. Maybe there's a way to unlock these games so that your pool of games you can play gets bigger. So it starts with like 3 and then as you play somehow, you can unlock other games that will grant you Keys. This way you're not overwhelmed with all of the options. 
- Might want to consider letting players purchase Keys for an extremely high price of points. 
- Perhaps they can make a text file that you can go in and edit the numbers the way you want them to be. 
- Create different 'click' behaviors based off of the type of game it is. 
- Have different games have different strengths and they are picked for the slots that you put them in. 
    - DPS
    - Armor
    - Health
    - Endurance
    - Special
- Come up with a store with other things you can purchase.
    - Keys at a high price. 
- Consider adding a star system to the games that you can level them up or prestige them with the points that you earn.
