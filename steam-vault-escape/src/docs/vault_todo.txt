To Do:
- Images for the games are stacked on top of each other. 
- The click number needs to flyout in a randomdirection from the edge of the game, starting small then growing and fading out. 
- Get rid of the frame around the card section. 
- Get rid of the gray transparent part over the locked cards as well as the red bars. Instead just move the lock to the center of the card. 

- The cost is way off. I can unlock all of my locked games in a matter of minutes. 
- I don't feel like I need to go play my unplayed games. 
- I think I need to 'slot' five games that earn passives and one that I can click on... or maybe all I can click on. 
- Create different 'click' behaviors based off of the type of game it is. 
- Might just be able to call it "Steam Vault" and not do the whole escape thing. 
- Lots of images aren't being displayed correctly, likey because Steam is bouncing you. 
- 10 points is way to cheap. Should be at least 100. 
- Perhaps they can make a text file that you can go in and edit the numbers the way you want them to be. 
- Clicking "play" doesn't load the steam store. 
- Need to see 'number go up' as well as 'bar go up' for passives. 

- Need to test at some point that you have actually unlocked a game by playing it.
