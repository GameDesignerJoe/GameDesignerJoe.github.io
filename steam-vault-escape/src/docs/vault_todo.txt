To Do:

BUGS:


FEATURES: 
- We need to make the buying a game from the store much more exciting. Right now you just click on it and it goes away. 
    - It should move to the center of the screen and have light shooting off of it. 
    - That sort of thing.
- Create different 'click' behaviors based off of the type of game it is. 
- Maybe only show like 20 unplayed games in the Key Games section. Maybe there's a way to unlock these games so that your pool of games you can play gets bigger. So it starts with like 3 and then as you play somehow, you can unlock other games that will grant you Keys. This way you're not overwhelmed with all of the options. 
- Might want to consider letting players purchase Keys for an extremely high price of points. 
- Have different games have different strengths and they are picked for the slots that you put them in. 
    - DPS
    - Armor
    - Health
    - Endurance
    - Special
- Come up with a store with other things you can purchase.
    - Keys at a high price. 
- Consider adding a star system to the games that you can level them up or prestige them with the points that you earn.
- There doesn't seem to be a lot of different between the Game Library and the Progress Tracker. Perhaps they should be combined into one thing. 
- A button at the bottom of each game in the Progress Track that says, "Go to Steam". Clicking anywhere else will put the game in the play area.
