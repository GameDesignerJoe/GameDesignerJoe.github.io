To Do:
- Game costs are off by a factor of 10. 
- We need to shrink everything down a bit so it can more easily fit on the screen without having to scroll. 
- I think we need a Games Played tab that shows the new games you've played since you started playing this game. It's like a trophy case that shows the games you started playing. You can't click on them or anything because it's just a display, but it shows what you've unlocked and maybe how many hours you've spent on it. 
- Maybe only show like 20 unplayed games in the Key Games section. Maybe there's a way to unlock these games so that your pool of games you can play gets bigger. So it starts with like 3 and then as you play somehow, you can unlock other games that will grant you Keys. This way you're not overwhelmed with all of the options. 
- Shouldn't be able to click on games that are drained and get them to move. In fact, clicking on a drained game in the Game Library should automatically take you to the Key Game Tab. 
- I don't like the count numbers for Game Library and Key Games. We should remove them. 
- I wish it didn't look like tabs, but tha'ts a minor thing. 
- We're not doing nay passives right now. 
- Where the Collection points is locatedis too far away. It needs to beright next to or above the game itself. 
- The Liberation Key cound needs to be bigger. 
- Need to rename this damn game 
- Might want to consider Letting players purchase Keys for an extremely high price of points. 
- Lots of images aren't being displayed correctly, likey because Steam is bouncing you. 
- Perhaps they can make a text file that you can go in and edit the numbers the way you want them to be. 
- Need to test at some point that you have actually unlocked a game by playing it. 
- Create different 'click' behaviors based off of the type of game it is. 
- Have different games have different strengths and they are picked for the slots that you put them in. 
    - DPS
    - Armor
    - Health
    - Endurance
    - Special
