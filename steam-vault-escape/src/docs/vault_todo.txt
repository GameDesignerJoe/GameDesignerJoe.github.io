To Do:
- The cost is way off. I can unlock all of my locked games in a matter of minutes. 
- I don't feel like I need to go play my unplayed games. 
- Might just be able to call it "Steam Vault" and not do the whole escape thing. 
- Lots of images aren't being displayed correctly, likey because Steam is bouncing you. 
- 10 points is way to cheap. Should be at least 100. 
- Perhaps they can make a text file that you can go in and edit the numbers the way you want them to be. 
- Need to see 'number go up' as well as 'bar go up' for passives. 
- Need to test at some point that you have actually unlocked a game by playing it. 
- Completely hide the locked games so you don't know what they are until you unlock them. You just know how much they cost and their rate of return.





Big Designs
- Maybe don't show them all of their library at all. But they only have like 3-5 possible games they can look at unlocking based off of cost. 
    2 cheap ones, 2 mid range ones, 1 expensive one. 
    They can spend points to add a new one to the stack or maybe reroll the ones that are there. It might be like a loot drop kind of fill when they see what ones they can work on trying to unlock. 
- Have games only be able to earn points up to a cap. Maybe their total play time. Then you have to play a new game to refresh them all. 
- Create different 'click' behaviors based off of the type of game it is. 
- I think I need to 'slot' five games that earn passives and one that I can click on... or maybe all I can click on. 
- Have different games have different strengths and they are picked for the slots that you put them in. 
    - DPS
    - Armor
    - Health
    - Endurance
    - Special
