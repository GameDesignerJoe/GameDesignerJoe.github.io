Steam Vault Escape - Game Design Document v1.5
Core Philosophy Change
v1.0 Problem: Players could unlock 50+ games instantly by clicking. No incentive to leave the site. Overwhelming choice paralysis with 300+ visible games.
v1.5 Solution: Gacha-style game pool with limited visibility (5 games at a time), forced drain mechanics, and dual-currency scarcity that pushes players to actually play Steam games.

The Three-Pool System
Pool 1: Game Library (Unlocked & Clickable)
Definition: Games the player has unlocked in the idle game and can actively click for Collection Power.
Behavior:

Visible in "Game Library" section
Clickable to generate Collection Power
Each click generates power = Steam playtime hours
Has MAX threshold = Steam Hours × 100
When MAX reached → becomes "DRAINED"
Drained games show dark overlay: "🔒 DRAINED - Refresh with keys"
Refresh cost = Metacritic ÷ 10 keys (rounded up)
Sorted by click value (highest power-per-click at top)

Starting State: 1 game only

Criteria: Metacritic 70-79, 5-10 hours played on Steam
If none match: Any game with 5-10 hours played
If still none: Lowest playtime game in library


Pool 2: Hidden Pool (Played but Locked)
Definition: All games the player has played on Steam but not yet unlocked in the idle game.
Behavior:

Completely invisible to player (hidden pool)
Feeds the 5-slot shop via random draws
Games revealed only when drawn into shop slots
Requires Collection Power to unlock → moves to Pool 1
New games enter this pool when Key Games are played

Starting State: All played Steam games minus:

The 1 starting unlocked game
The 5 games initially drawn into shop


Pool 3: Key Games (Never Played)
Definition: All Steam games with 0 minutes playtime.
Behavior:

Displayed in "KEY GAMES" section as visual gallery
Full game cover art visible
Shows Metacritic score converted to key value: "🔑 87 Keys"
Click game → Opens Steam store page in Steam app
When played 30+ minutes on Steam:

Award keys = Metacritic score
Move game from Pool 3 → Pool 2
Auto-refresh all drained games in Pool 1 (free)
Game now eligible for future shop draws



UI Display:

Grid layout showing all never-played games
Each card shows: Game art, title, key value
Hover text: "Click to launch Steam"
No unlock button (can only unlock by playing on actual Steam)


The 5-Slot Shop System

Starting Distribution (Curated):

Slot 1: Cheap tier (unlock cost <1,000 power)
Slot 2: Cheap tier (unlock cost <1,000 power)
Slot 3: Moderate tier (unlock cost 1,000-3,000 power)
Slot 4: Moderate tier (unlock cost 1,000-3,000 power)
Slot 5: Epic tier (unlock cost 3,000+ power)

Unlock Cost Formula:
Collection Power Cost = Metacritic × Hours to Beat
Keys Cost = None (shop games don't cost keys)
Examples:

75 Metacritic, 8 hours → 600 Power (Cheap)
82 Metacritic, 25 hours → 2,050 Power (Moderate)
90 Metacritic, 50 hours → 4,500 Power (Epic)

After Unlocking a Shop Game:

Game moves from shop → Pool 1 (Game Library)
Shop slot becomes empty
Empty slot shows: "🔒 Spend 10 Keys to Draw New Game"
Player must spend 10 keys to fill slot


Draw New Game Mechanic
The Flow:
Step 1: Player clicks empty shop slot

Cost: 10 Liberation Keys
Opens "Draw New Game" UI overlay

Step 2: Slot machine interface

Shows 3 card backs (🎴 🎴 🎴)
Player clicks one card back
Behind the scenes: Game is predetermined via weighted random from Pool 2

Step 3: Reveal animation

Selected card flips to reveal game art
Shows game name, Metacritic, unlock cost
Game fills the empty shop slot

Step 4: Redraw option

"Don't like it? Redraw for 5 Keys"
Costs 5 keys to redraw (no escalation)
Completely new random roll from Pool 2
Can redraw unlimited times (5 keys each)

Draw Targeting (Weighted by Tier):
When drawing to fill a slot, weight the roll based on what tier was previously there:
If empty slot was CHEAP:

70% chance: Draw another Cheap game
20% chance: Draw Moderate game
10% chance: Draw Epic game (lucky!)

If empty slot was MODERATE:

20% chance: Draw Cheap game
60% chance: Draw another Moderate game
20% chance: Draw Epic game

If empty slot was EPIC:

10% chance: Draw Cheap game (unlucky)
20% chance: Draw Moderate game
70% chance: Draw another Epic game

Purpose: Maintains shop balance while allowing occasional surprises.

Currency Systems
Collection Power (Idle Currency)
Generation:

Click unlocked games in Game Library
Each click = [Game's Steam Hours] power
Passive generation from total unlocked games (minor)

Usage:

Unlock games from 5-slot shop
No other uses

Display:

Top stats bar: "Collection Power: 8,450"


Liberation Keys (Premium Currency)
Generation:

ONLY earned by playing Pool 3 games for 30+ minutes
Amount earned = Game's Metacritic score
Example: Play 87-rated game → +87 keys

Usage:

Draw new games (10 keys per draw)
Redraw games (5 keys per redraw)
Refresh drained games (Metacritic ÷ 10 keys per game)

Display:

Top stats bar: "🔑 84 Keys"

Key Scarcity:
Playing one 80-rated game = 80 keys, enough to:

Draw 8 new shop games, OR
Draw 4 + redraw 8 times, OR
Unlock 1 + refresh 7 drained games

Core Loop
Session Flow:
1. Start with 1 unlocked game + 5 locked shop games
2. Click unlocked game → Generate Collection Power
3. Game drains after ~5-10 minutes of clicking
4. Unlock 1-2 cheap shop games with earned power
5. Click those new games → They drain too
6. Now mostly stuck:
   - Not enough power for remaining expensive shop games
   - No keys to draw new games or refresh drained ones
7. PRESSURE POINT: Must either:
   A. Play a Key Game (30+ min on Steam) to earn keys
   B. Slowly grind minimal passive income (boring)
8. Player leaves site → Plays "Hades" on Steam
9. Returns after 35 minutes:
   - +93 keys awarded
   - Hades moved Pool 3 → Pool 2
   - All drained games auto-refreshed (free)
10. Spend keys:
    - Draw 2 new shop games (20 keys)
    - Redraw 1 (5 keys)
    - Unlock those with power
11. Continue clicking → Repeat cycle
Target timing: 15-30 minutes of clicking before forced to leave and play.

Visual Design Changes from v1.0
Removed:

❌ Single click card (now multiple unlocked games)
❌ All games visible at once (now limited shop)
❌ Instant unlock progression (now gated by draws)
❌ Unlimited clicking (now drain mechanic)

Added:

✅ Three distinct sections (Library, Shop, Key Games)
✅ Drain/refresh mechanic with visual overlays
✅ Slot machine draw UI with card reveal
✅ Empty slot states requiring keys
✅ Key Games gallery with click-to-Steam
✅ Progress bars on active games
✅ Tier-based visual borders (cheap/moderate/epic)


Progression Balance
Early Game (0-30 minutes):

Unlock 2-3 cheap games
Drain all games
Hit key scarcity wall
Forced to play Key Game

Mid Game (1-5 hours):

Rotating between clicking and playing Key Games
Shop fills with moderate-tier games
Building up Game Library to 10-15 games
Keys become main bottleneck

Late Game (5+ hours):

Large Game Library (20+ games)
Epic games appearing in shop
Strategic choices: Draw new vs refresh drained vs unlock expensive
Key Games list shrinking as played

End Game (20+ hours):

Most games unlocked
Only highest-tier games left in shop
Key Games nearly exhausted
Victory condition: Unlock all games from Pool 2


Success Metrics
We'll know it works when:

Players spend 15-30 min clicking before leaving (not hours)
Average Key Game playtime >30 minutes (they're actually playing)
Unlock rate = 2-4 games per session (not 50)
Draw mechanic used frequently (keys have value)
Players express desire for specific locked games in shop
Key scarcity creates meaningful choices


Future Features (Post-v1.5)

Daily challenges (bonus keys for genres)
Prestige system (reset with permanent multipliers)
Collection milestones (unlock all RPGs → bonus)
Passive key generation (1 key per hour played from library)
Friend leaderboards (who unlocked more this week)
Bulk refresh (refresh all drained games at once)


End of GDD v1.5
