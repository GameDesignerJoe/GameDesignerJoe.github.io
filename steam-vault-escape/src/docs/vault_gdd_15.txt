Steam Vault Escape - Game Design Document v1.5
Core Philosophy: Force players to leave the idle game and play actual Steam games by making it the most rewarding action in the loop.

Major Changes from v1.0:
Problems Solved:

❌ Players could unlock everything by clicking, never playing games
❌ No incentive to leave the site
❌ Unlocking 50 games at once made them meaningless
❌ Hidden games were boring gray boxes

New Design:

✅ Played games max out and lock until you play something new
✅ Playing one unplayed game = massive power spike (clears all locks)
✅ Dual currency makes progression meaningful
✅ Locked games shown as enticing silhouettes


Core Loop (The Heart of Everything)
The Cycle:
1. Click unlocked games → Generate Collection Power
2. Games reach MAX (based on actual Steam playtime hours)
3. All maxed games become unclickable
4. Stuck? → Play a NEW Steam game for 30+ minutes
5. Return to site → ALL games reset + earn Keys
6. Unlock better games → Repeat
Key Insight: Playing one new game >> 1000 clicks

Currency Systems
Collection Power (Idle Currency)

Generated by clicking unlocked game cards
Each game gives points = its Steam playtime hours
Example: Game with 15 hours played = +15 power per click
Passive generation from total collection size
Used to unlock common/mid-tier games

Liberation Keys 🔑 (Premium Currency)

ONLY earned by playing unplayed Steam games for 30+ minutes
Amount = Game's Metacritic score (84 rating = 84 keys)
Cannot be generated by clicking or waiting
Required to unlock high-tier games


Game States & Behavior
Unlocked Games (Playable):

Show full game cover art
Clickable to generate Collection Power
Each click gives: [Game's Steam Hours Played] points
MAX threshold: [Game's Steam Hours × 100] total points
When MAX reached → card becomes locked/grayed out

Example:

Valheim (150 hours played on Steam)
Each click = +150 Collection Power
MAX at: 15,000 points (150 × 100)
After MAX: Card locks, no more clicking

Locked Games (Not Yet Unlocked):

Show as silhouette/outline (not black screen)
Display game name faintly
Show unlock cost clearly:

  🔒 Portal 2
  
  Unlock Cost:
  7,560 Collection Power
  84 🔑 Keys
  
  ⭐ 95 Metacritic
  ⏱️ 10 hours to beat

Hovering shows brief description/premise
Creates "I want THAT" desire

Maxed Out Games (Temporarily Locked):

Unlocked games that hit MAX threshold
Shown with dark overlay + ⚠️ icon
Text: "MAXED - Play new game to reset"
Unclickable until player plays new Steam game
This creates pressure to leave


Unlock Cost Formula
Formula:
Collection Power Cost = Metacritic × Hours to Beat
Liberation Keys Cost = Metacritic score
Examples:
Portal 2:

Metacritic: 95
Hours to Beat: 8
Cost: 760 Power + 95 Keys

Hollow Knight:

Metacritic: 87
Hours to Beat: 27
Cost: 2,349 Power + 87 Keys

Short indie gem (Unpacking):

Metacritic: 84
Hours to Beat: 4
Cost: 336 Power + 84 Keys

Long mediocre game:

Metacritic: 65
Hours to Beat: 40
Cost: 2,600 Power + 65 Keys

Rationale:

Quality games (high Metacritic) cost more Keys
Long games cost more Power
Prevents exploiting either metric
Short masterpieces still valuable (high Keys)


Progression Balance
Target Loop Timing:

Start with 8 unlocked games (player's most-played)
Click for ~5-10 minutes → unlock 2-3 new games
~15-20 min total → all games MAXED OUT
Forced choice: Keep clicking for nothing OR play new game
Play new game (30+ min commitment)
Return → Everything reset + big key reward
Can now unlock 3-5 better games

Goal: ~30 min of clicking before forced to play something new.
Key Scarcity:
Playing a 90-rated game for 30+ min = 90 Keys
That's enough to unlock:

1 epic game (90+ rating)
OR 2 good games (75-85 rating)
OR 3 decent games (60-75 rating)

Each unlock should feel meaningful, not disposable.

Detection System
How We Know Player Played a Game:
When user returns to site:

Check Steam API for updated playtime
Compare cached library vs current library
If ANY never-played game now has 30+ minutes:

Award Keys = Game's Metacritic score
Show celebration: "🎉 You played [Game]! +84 🔑 Keys earned!"
Reset ALL maxed-out games
Update cache



Technical:

Store last known playtime in localStorage: lastPlaytime_[appId]
On each visit, compare current playtime - last playtime
If delta ≥ 30 minutes on previously unplayed game = reward

"Hack and slash your way out of hell"

Progress: ████████░░ 85%
(You need 350 more Power + 10 more Keys)
Shows what you're working toward - creates desire.

Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Core Loop Fix):

Add MAX threshold system to unlocked games
Lock games when MAX reached
Add "Maxed Out" visual state
Add warning when all games maxed
Implement "play new game clears all" logic

Phase 2 (Keys System):

Add Liberation Keys currency
Detect Steam playtime changes
Award Keys based on Metacritic score
Show celebration when Keys earned
Update stats display

Phase 3 (Unlock Economics):

Implement new unlock cost formula
Require both Power AND Keys to unlock
Tier games by cost (show rarity)
Balance starting unlocks (8 most-played)

Phase 4 (Visual Polish):

Create locked game silhouettes
Add "Next Unlock" featured section
Show progress bars on active games
Add celebration animations
Improve hover states


Technical Implementation Notes for Cline
Data Storage (localStorage):
typescriptinterface SaveData {
  collectionPower: number;
  liberationKeys: number;
  unlockedGames: number[]; // App IDs
  gameProgress: {
    [appId: number]: {
      currentPower: number;
      maxPower: number;
      isMaxed: boolean;
    }
  };
  lastPlaytimeCheck: {
    [appId: number]: number; // minutes
  };
}
Key Functions Needed:
calculateMaxPower(gameHours: number): number

Returns: gameHours × 100

calculateUnlockCost(metacritic: number, hoursTobeat: number)

Returns: { power: metacritic × hoursTobeat, keys: metacritic }

checkForNewGamePlayed(cachedLibrary, currentLibrary)

Compares playtime
Awards Keys if delta ≥ 30 min on unplayed game
Resets all maxed games
Shows celebration

resetMaxedGames()

Sets all isMaxed to false
Resets currentPower to 0 for maxed games

handleGameClick(appId: number)

If game not maxed: Add power, update progress
If game maxed: Show message "Play new game to unlock"
Update progress bar

Game Card Logic:
typescriptfunction GameCard({ game, progress }) {
  const isLocked = !unlockedGames.includes(game.appid);
  const isMaxed = progress?.isMaxed || false;
  const isClickable = !isLocked && !isMaxed;
  
  if (isLocked) {
    return <LockedGameSilhouette game={game} />;
  }
  
  if (isMaxed) {
    return <MaxedOutCard game={game} />;
  }
  
  return <ClickableGameCard game={game} progress={progress} />;
}
Starting State:
When user first loads:

Fetch Steam library
Sort by playtime (highest first)
Unlock top 8 most-played games automatically
Initialize Collection Power = 0
Initialize Keys = 0
All other games locked


Success Metrics
We'll know it's working when:

Average session length = 10-15 minutes (not 2 hours of mindless clicking)
Players leave site to play games (detect playtime increases)
Unlock rate = 2-3 games per new game played (not 50)
Players express desire for specific locked games
Key scarcity creates meaningful choices


Future Considerations (Not v1.5)

Daily challenges (bonus keys for playing specific genres)
Prestige system (reset with permanent bonuses)
Friend competitions (who unlocked more this week)
Limited-time featured unlocks
Achievements for unlock milestones
