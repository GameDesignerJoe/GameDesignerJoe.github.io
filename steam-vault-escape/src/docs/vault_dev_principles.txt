Development Notes for Cline

Working Principles:
Implement milestones sequentially - Don't skip ahead
Test after each milestone - Verify functionality before moving on
Save frequently - localStorage corruption can lose progress
Log to console - Debug pool states, draws, calculations
Ask for clarification - If requirements unclear, ask Joe
Keep it simple - Don't over-engineer, iterate later

Code Style:
TypeScript strict mode
Functional components (React hooks)
TailwindCSS for styling
Extract reusable logic to utility files
Comment complex algorithms
Use meaningful variable names

Testing Strategy:
Console.log pool states after operations
Verify localStorage after each save
Test with different library sizes
Test edge cases (empty pools, no keys, etc.)
Use Joe's Steam ID for real-world testing
