# Steam Vault Escape - Game Design Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 28, 2024  
**Status:** Pre-Production

---

## Executive Summary

**Steam Vault Escape** is an idle clicker game that gamifies playing unplayed Steam games by trapping the player's already-played games in "The Vault." The only way to free these games is by playing the games they've been avoiding - turning backlog anxiety into a playful progression system.

**Core Loop:**
- Player's played games are locked and cost points to unlock
- Unplayed games (Liberation Keys) can be played on Steam for 30 minutes to unlock them
- Unlocked games generate passive points and can be actively clicked
- Points are spent to unlock more played games
- Goal: Unlock entire library by playing neglected games

**Target Audience:** Steam users with large backlogs (100-300+ games) who want motivation to try unplayed titles.

**Platform:** Web application (integrates with Steam API)

---

## Game Vision & Goals

### **Primary Goal:**
Drive players to actually play their unplayed Steam games by making it the fastest path to progression.

### **Player Experience Goals:**
- **Immediate engagement:** Satisfying click feedback, numbers go up
- **Clear purpose:** "Free my trapped games"
- **Meaningful choices:** Which games to unlock? Which keys to play?
- **Sense of accomplishment:** Watching library unlock over time
- **Discovery:** Rediscovering forgotten games in collection

### **Design Pillars:**
1. **Personal:** Uses player's actual Steam library (not generic content)
2. **Respectful:** No shaming for backlog, playful framing
3. **Rewarding:** Both passive progress and active clicking matter
4. **Transparent:** Clear math, visible progression, predictable outcomes
5. **Flexible:** Can engage deeply or casually

---

## Core Mechanics

### **1. The Three Game States**

#### **🔒 LOCKED (Played Games)**
- **Definition:** Any game with playtime > 0 hours
- **Visual:** Darkened, bars/shutters overlay, grayed out
- **Cost to unlock:** `hours² × 0.5` points (exponential)
- **Purpose:** Aspiration goals, rewards unlocking
- **Interaction:** [UNLOCK] button (spends points)

**Example costs:**
```
5 hours played = 12 points
50 hours = 1,250 points
100 hours = 5,000 points
347 hours = 60,244 points
1000 hours = 500,000 points
```

---

#### **✅ PLAYABLE (Unlocked Games)**
- **Definition:** Games that have been unlocked (or Vault Controller)
- **Visual:** Full color, glowing border, animated
- **Passive income:** `hours × 0.1` points per second
- **Click value:** `hours × 0.2` points per click
- **Purpose:** Core income source, active engagement target
- **Interaction:** Click to set as Featured Game, or generates passively

**Example earnings:**
```
5 hours → 0.5/sec passive, 1/click
50 hours → 5/sec passive, 10/click
100 hours → 10/sec passive, 20/click
347 hours → 34.7/sec passive, 69.4/click
```

---

#### **⭐ LIBERATION KEYS (Unplayed Games)**
- **Definition:** Games with exactly 0 hours playtime
- **Visual:** Gold shimmer, particle effects, special badge
- **Unlock method:** Play on Steam for 30+ minutes (FREE unlock)
- **Bonus on unlock:** `50 + (minutes × 0.5)` points
- **Purpose:** Fastest progression path, core incentive
- **Interaction:** [PLAY ON STEAM] button → launches game

**Unlock rewards:**
```
30 min played = 65 points bonus + 0.05/sec passive
60 min = 80 points + 0.1/sec passive
120 min = 110 points + 0.2/sec passive
```

---

### **2. The Vault Controller (Starter Game)**

**Purpose:** Gives player something to click immediately

**Properties:**
- Fake game inserted at top of library
- Always unlocked, cannot be locked
- Stats equivalent to 5 hours played:
  - 0.5 points/sec passive
  - 1 point/click active
- Visual: Custom vault/gear icon
- Position: First game in grid (teaches mechanic)

**Flavor text:** "Your only tool at the start. Click to earn points and begin freeing your collection."

---

### **3. Progression Systems**

#### **Points (Primary Currency)**
- **Earned by:**
  - Clicking Featured Game (active engagement)
  - Passive generation from unlocked games (idle progress)
  - Bonus from Liberation Key unlocks (playing Steam games)
- **Spent on:**
  - Unlocking locked (played) games
- **Display:** Large number with commas, prominently placed
- **Accumulation:** Tab-active only (no offline earnings)

#### **Featured Game System**
- Player clicks any unlocked game → becomes Featured
- Featured game appears enlarged above grid
- Big [CLICK TO PLAY] button
- Shows click value prominently
- Can change featured game anytime (no cost)
- Not auto-selected (player must learn to select)

#### **Passive Income**
- All unlocked games generate points per second
- Calculated: Sum of all unlocked games' `hours × 0.1`
- Only generates while tab is active and focused
- Displayed as: "Your X games generate +Y/sec"
- Updates in real-time every second

---

---

### **Mid-Game Loop (10-50 hours total play):**

```
Player alternates between:
- Clicking Featured Game (active)
- Unlocking locked games (spending)
- Playing Liberation Keys (real Steam play)
- Watching passive income grow (idle satisfaction)

Strategic decisions:
- "Do I unlock this 50-hour game now (1,250 pts)?"
- "Or save for 100-hour game (5,000 pts)?"
- "Or just play more Liberation Keys for faster income?"

Liberation Keys become routine:
- Player knows they're the fastest progression
- Trying 5-10 new games per session
- Income compounding exponentially
```

---

### **End-Game (100+ hours total play):**

```
- Most cheap/mid games unlocked
- Passive income: 200-500/sec
- Working on expensive games (500+ hours each)
- Liberation Keys still valuable
- Each new unlock feels earned
- Library completion within sight

Final push:
- Unlock last few ultra-expensive games
- Play remaining Liberation Keys
- Reach 100% library unlock
- Victory screen appears
```

## Progression Balance

### **Economy Design Philosophy:**

**Early Game: Fast Momentum**
- Unlock 5-10 games in first 15 minutes
- Passive income grows quickly (0.5 → 2/sec)
- Liberation Keys obviously valuable
- Player feels progress immediately

**Mid Game: Strategic Choices**
- Unlock costs rising exponentially
- Income from Liberation Keys becomes critical
- Trade-offs: unlock now vs save for later
- Playing unplayed games feels rewarding

**Late Game: Satisfying Completion**
- High passive income (200-500/sec)
- Expensive games affordable (5-10 min each)
- Liberation Keys still provide boosts
- Final unlocks feel earned, not grindy

**Exponential Unlock Cost Curve:**
```
0-20 hours: Cheap (1-200 pts)
21-50 hours: Mid (200-1,250 pts)
51-100 hours: Expensive (1,250-5,000 pts)
101-500 hours: Very Expensive (5,000-125,000 pts)
500+ hours: Ultra Rare (125,000-500,000+ pts)
```

**Linear Income Growth:**
```
Every unlocked game adds predictable income
Every Liberation Key adds ~0.1/sec
Compound growth from many small sources
No single game dominates (unless 1000+ hours)
```

## Success Metrics

### **Player Engagement:**
- % of users who unlock at least 1 game
- % who play at least 1 Liberation Key
- Average session duration
- Return rate (come back after playing Steam game)

### **Core Loop Validation:**
- Time to first unlock (should be <5 min)
- Time to first Liberation Key unlock (should be <30 min)
- Number of Liberation Keys played per user
- Average games unlocked per session

### **Progression Health:**
- Distribution of unlock costs vs income rates
- Average time to unlock expensive games (should feel achievable)
- % of users who reach 50% library unlocked
- % who reach 100% completion

### **Qualitative Goals:**
- Does it feel fun to click?
- Do Liberation Keys feel rewarding?
- Is progression clear and understandable?
- Do players feel motivated to try unplayed games?

---

## Risk Assessment

### **Potential Issues:**

**1. Math Imbalance**
- Risk: Progression too fast or too slow
- Mitigation: Playtesting with various library sizes, tunable formulas

**2. Steam API Limits**
- Risk: Rate limiting, downtime, privacy restrictions
- Mitigation: Caching, graceful degradation, error handling

**3. Player Motivation**
- Risk: Liberation Keys not compelling enough
- Mitigation: Clear rewards, celebration animations, immediate feedback

**4. Technical Performance**
- Risk: Large libraries (500+ games) cause lag
- Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, optimization

**5. Complexity Creep**
- Risk: Adding too many features, losing focus
- Mitigation: Strict MVP scope, post-launch roadmap

---

## Conclusion

**Steam Vault Escape** transforms Steam backlog anxiety into a playful idle game. By locking played games and making unplayed games the key to progression, it creates a compelling incentive to actually try neglected titles.

The core loop is simple: click, unlock, play Steam games, repeat. The math is transparent and tunable. The visual design leverages familiar Steam aesthetics. The progression is satisfying from first click to final unlock.

**Next Steps:**
1. Technical Design Document (implementation details)
2. Milestone Plan (MVP → launch roadmap)
3. Prototyping and playtesting
4. Iterative balance tuning
