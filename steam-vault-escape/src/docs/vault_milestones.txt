# Steam Vault Escape - Milestone Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 28, 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step development roadmap for **Steam Vault Escape**, a standalone idle clicker game separate from the Steam Stash analytics tool.

**Project Scope:**
- **Separate codebase** from Steam Stash
- **New Next.js project** (steam-vault-escape)
- **Independent deployment** on Vercel
- **Standalone experience** (can link to Steam Stash but not required)

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build incrementally (prove each system works before adding more)
- Test frequently (catch issues early)
- Stay flexible (adjust based on playtesting)
- Focus on core loop (bells and whistles come later)

- **Storage quota:** Mitigation: Compress data, clear old cache

### **Design Risks:**
- **Progression too slow:** Mitigation: Tunable formulas, playtesting
- **Liberation Keys not compelling:** Mitigation: Better rewards, animations
- **Complexity confusing:** Mitigation: Minimal tutorial, clear UI

### **Scope Risks:**
- **Feature creep:** Mitigation: Strict MVP scope, post-launch roadmap
- **Over-engineering:** Mitigation: Build simplest version first
- **Time overruns:** Mitigation: No deadlines, flexible milestones

---

## Conclusion

This milestone plan provides a clear path from empty project to fully functional idle game. Each milestone builds on the previous one, proving each system works before adding more complexity.

The key is staying focused on the core loop:
1. Click games to earn points
2. Unlock locked games
3. Play Liberation Keys for fastest progression
4. Reach 100% library unlock

Everything else is secondary. Build the foundation solid, then add polish.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete Milestone 0 (Foundation)
2. Build Milestone 1 (Steam Integration)
3. Iterate through milestones in order
4. Playtest frequently, adjust as needed
5. Launch when core loop feels fun!
