We're looking at breaking up page.tsx so that it's not so massive and doesn't take up as much processing power for the AI to use. 

Breaking up `page.tsx` would:

- ✅ Reduce context usage per edit (smaller files = fewer tokens)
- ✅ Improve code maintainability
- ✅ Make it easier to find and edit specific features
- ✅ Follow React best practices (separation of concerns)

## Refactoring Plan: Component Extraction

Here's how I'd break up the massive `page.tsx` file:

### 🎯 New Component Files to Create:

1. __`components/SteamIdInput.tsx`__

   - Steam ID input modal
   - \~50 lines

2. __`components/CelebrationModal.tsx`__

   - Key Game celebration screen (the one we just created!)
   - \~60 lines

3. __`components/VictoryModal.tsx`__

   - Victory screen when all games unlocked
   - \~40 lines

4. __`components/DrawModal.tsx`__

   - Card drawing system with flip animations
   - \~80 lines

5. __`components/DevPanel.tsx`__

   - Developer tools panel
   - \~100 lines

6. __`components/FeaturedGameDisplay.tsx`__

   - The large clickable featured game with power bar
   - \~120 lines

7. __`components/ShopSection.tsx`__

   - Shop with 5 slots for drawing games
   - \~80 lines

8. __`components/GameLibrary.tsx`__

   - Tabbed library (Game Library + Key Games tabs)
   - \~150 lines

9. __`components/ToastNotification.tsx`__ (optional - for future error alerts)

   - Toast notification system
   - \~30 lines

### 📊 Result:

- __Current:__ 1 file @ ~1,500 lines
- __After:__ 10 files @ ~50-150 lines each
- __Main page.tsx:__ Reduced to ~200-300 lines (just state management + layout)

### 🎁 Benefits:

- Each component is independently editable (no more huge file reads!)
- Easier to test individual features
- Better code organization
- Future AI assistance will be much more efficient
