# Fellowship Map Content Visualization Tool - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the implementation approach for the Fellowship Map Content Visualization Tool, a web-based application that helps game designers visualize content distribution across the game map. The plan defines development phases, priorities, and milestones to guide the implementation process.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders
- Game Design Team (primary users)
- Development Team (implementers)
- Art Team (for visual integration)
- Production (for scheduling and resource allocation)

## 2. Development Approach

### 2.1 Development Philosophy
The tool will be developed using an iterative approach:

1. Validate the development environment and technical foundation
2. Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers core functionality
3. Gather feedback from designers using the MVP
4. Implement enhancements in prioritized phases
5. Continuously refine based on user feedback

### 2.2 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: HTML5 Canvas API (with potential for Konva.js if needed)
