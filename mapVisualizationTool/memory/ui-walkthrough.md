# Fellowship Map Content Visualization Tool - UI Walkthrough

[Previous content remains the same until the Map Navigation section...]

### Map Navigation
The map supports intuitive navigation controls with a sophisticated coordinate transformation system:

- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the map
  - Cursor changes to indicate when panning is available
  - Smooth movement with acceleration
  - Bounds checking to prevent over-panning
  - Maintains content positions through coordinate transformation
- **Zoom**: 
  - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out (0.5x to 8.0x range)
  - Maintains point under cursor while zooming
  - Uses normalized coordinates for content stability
  - Pixel-perfect rendering at all zoom levels
  - Smooth transitions between detail levels
- **Reset**: "Reset Map" button returns to initial view and position

### Coordinate System
The map uses a sophisticated coordinate system for content placement and rendering:

- **Normalized Coordinates**: All content positions stored as (0-1) coordinates
  - Resolution independent
  - Coordinates remain valid if map dimensions change
  - Easy to reason about as percentages of map dimensions
- **Real-World Measurements**: All sizes specified in meters
  - Content sizes scale appropriately with zoom
  - Grid cells represent specific real-world distances
  - Consistent measurement system across all features
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Handles conversion between coordinate spaces
  - Map coordinates to screen coordinates
  - Maintains aspect ratio
  - Accounts for zoom level and pan offset
  - Ensures pixel-perfect rendering

### Content Representation
Each content type is represented according to its defined properties:

- **Shape**: Matches the selected shape (circle, square, hexagon, irregular)
- **Color**: Uses the defined color from the content type
- **Size**: Uses real-world measurements (meters) and scales with zoom level
- **Positioning**: Uses normalized coordinates (0-1) for zoom independence
- **Validation**: Only placed on non-transparent portions of the map
- **Rendering**: Pixel-perfect drawing with proper scaling and transformation

### Content Placement
The system ensures accurate content placement through:

- **Transparency Validation**: 
  - Creates temporary canvas for image analysis
  - Checks alpha channel values
  - Only places content on visible map areas
- **Position Persistence**:
  - Normalized coordinates ensure stability across zoom levels
  - Content maintains relative positions during navigation
  - Proper scaling maintains size relationships
- **Real-World Scale**:
  - All measurements in meters for consistency
  - Sizes scale appropriately with zoom level
  - Grid provides visual reference for scale
