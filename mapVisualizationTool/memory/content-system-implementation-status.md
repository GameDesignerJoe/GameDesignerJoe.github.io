# Content System Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Content Instance Manager ✅
- [x] Created ContentInstanceManager.ts with base functionality
- [x] Defined ContentInstance interface
- [x] Implemented basic validation system
- [x] Migrated Debug Dots to use ContentInstanceManager
- [x] Verified Debug Dots functionality works through new system

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Generic Rendering System ✅
- [x] Create shape rendering functions
- [x] Implement generic content rendering pipeline
- [x] Add size calculation system
- [x] Add debug visualization options

    #### Implemented Features
    - Multiple shape types (circle, square, hexagon) with factory pattern
    - Normalized-to-screen coordinate transformation
    - Real-world size calculations (meters to pixels)
    - Advanced styling options (gradients, shadows, opacity)
    - Debug visualization with coordinate display
    - Label rendering with customizable appearance
    - Selection and highlighting states

### Phase 3: Distribution System
- [x] Create generic distribution interface ✅
  - Created ContentDistributor interface
  - Implemented helper functions for distance and transparency validation
  - Added distribution constraints configuration
  - Created DistributorFactory for managing strategies
- [ ] Port random distribution from Debug Dots
- [ ] Add minimum spacing enforcement
- [ ] Implement basic clustering

#### Implemented Features
- Generic distribution interface with support for multiple strategies
- Distribution constraints system for configuring placement rules
- Factory pattern for managing and extending distribution strategies
- Helper functions for coordinate validation and distance calculations

### Phase 4: Validation System
- [ ] Port transparency validation from Debug Dots
- [ ] Add spacing validation
- [ ] Add biome validation
- [ ] Add basic proximity rules

### Phase 5: Content Type Integration
- [ ] Add ContentType to instance generation
- [ ] Add instance to UI feedback
- [ ] Add basic property editing
- [ ] Add instance selection

### Phase 6: Serialization & Persistence
- [ ] Add basic JSON serialization
- [ ] Add LocalStorage persistence
- [ ] Add export to file
- [ ] Add import from file

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add spatial partitioning
- [ ] Add render batching
- [ ] Add instance caching
- [ ] Add viewport culling

## Current Implementation Details

### ContentInstanceManager
The ContentInstanceManager now provides:
- Instance storage by type ID
- Basic validation of instances
- Add/remove/get operations
- Type-safe instance management

### Debug Dots Integration
Debug Dots have been successfully migrated to use the new system:
- Uses normalized coordinates (0-1)
- Uses real-world measurements in meters
- Stores dot properties (size, debug state)
- Maintains all existing functionality

### Next Implementation Focus
Phase 3: Distribution System
- Create generic distribution interface
- Port random distribution from Debug Dots
- Add minimum spacing enforcement
- Implement basic clustering
