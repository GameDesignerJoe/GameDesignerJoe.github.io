## Current Implementation Details

### ContentInstanceManager
The ContentInstanceManager now provides:
- Instance storage by type ID
- Basic validation of instances
- Add/remove/get operations
- Type-safe instance management
- Real-time instance count tracking
- Batch update operations

### Debug Dots Integration
Debug Dots have been successfully migrated to use the new system:
- Uses normalized coordinates (0-1)
- Uses real-world measurements in meters
- Stores dot properties (size, debug state)
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Synchronized instance count display
- Real-time property updates
- Uses distribution system for placement

### Next Implementation Focus

  - Add validation rules configuration
  - Add rule-based validation pipeline
  - Add validation result reporting
- Implement biome validation
  - Add biome data structure
  - Add biome-based placement rules
  - Add biome compatibility checking
- Implement proximity rules
  - Add proximity detection system
  - Add proximity-based constraints
  - Add proximity visualization
