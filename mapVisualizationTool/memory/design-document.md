# Fellowship Map Content Visualization Tool - Design Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Map Content Visualization Tool will provide game designers with an intuitive interface for visualizing content distribution and density across the Fellowship game map. This tool will help designers understand spatial relationships between different content types, evaluate player progression paths, and optimize content placement for engaging gameplay experiences.

### 1.2 Goals
- Visualize content density and distribution across the game map
- Provide mathematical analysis of content density, player travel time, and engagement metrics
- Support rapid iteration of content distribution strategies
- Create shareable visualizations for team discussions
- Inform engineering resource requirements for content implementation

### 1.3 Scope
This tool is intended for high-level content planning and visualization, not precise content placement for implementation. It provides a "big picture" view of how different content types would be distributed across the game map based on designer-specified parameters.

## 2. User Requirements

### 2.1 Primary Users
Game designers who need to plan, visualize, and balance content across Fellowship's open world.

### 2.2 User Stories
- As a designer, I want to visualize how many enemy encounters would fit in a specific region, so I can plan content density.
- As a designer, I want to see the impact of increasing the number of activities on overall map density.
- As a designer, I want to experiment with different biome distributions to evaluate player exploration patterns.
- As a designer, I want to understand how different content types interact spatially, so I can create varied gameplay.
- As a design team, we want to share consistent visualizations to align on content strategy.

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1 Three-Panel Interface
The tool will provide a three-panel interface:

1. **Input Panel**: Form controls for configuring map parameters and content types
2. **Analysis Panel**: Text-based metrics and warnings based on content distribution
3. **Map Panel**: Visual representation of the map with placed content

### 3.2 Map Configuration
Designers can specify:
- Map dimensions (width and height in kilometers)
- Visual cell size for the grid overlay (visual representation only, each cell always represents 1 meter in-game)
- Visual parameters (background map, grid visibility, grid opacity)

### 3.3 Content Definition
Designers can create content types with properties including:
- Name and category
- Visual representation (color, shape, icon)
- Size and shape
- Quantity and distribution parameters
- Placement rules (biome restrictions, overlap permissions)

### 3.4 Content Generation
The tool will algorithmically distribute content across the map based on specified parameters, following rules for:
- Biome constraints
- Spacing between similar content
- Proximity requirements to other content
- Overlap permissions

### 3.5 Analysis
The tool will calculate and display:
- Content density metrics (items per square kilometer)
- Estimated player travel times between content
- Balance metrics for different content categories
- Warnings for potential issues (overcrowding, empty zones)

### 3.6 Visualization
The map visualization will include:
- Color-coded biomes
- Icons/shapes for different content types
- Legend for map elements
- Optional square grid overlay (only visible on non-transparent portions of the map)
- Comprehensive level of detail system that adapts grid visualization based on zoom level

#### 3.6.1 Level of Detail System
The visualization implements a sophisticated level of detail system that enables efficient rendering and appropriate representation at different zoom levels:

- **Multiple Detail Categories**: High, Medium, and Low detail levels
- **Granular Detail Levels**: 10 distinct detail levels across the categories
- **Adaptive Cell Representation**: Each cell represents between 1m and 1km based on zoom level
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless transitions between detail levels while zooming
- **Content Aggregation**: Intelligent aggregation of content at lower detail levels
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for very large maps (up to 50 square km)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current scale and detail level

This system ensures that designers can work with maps of any size while maintaining both performance and visual clarity. At high zoom levels, fine details are visible for precise work, while at low zoom levels, the system provides an appropriate overview without overwhelming visual information.

### 3.7 Export/Sharing
Designers can export:
- PNG image of the map visualization
- Configuration data for recreating the visualization
- Analysis reports

## 4. Content Types and Properties

### 4.1 Core Content Properties
All content types will support the following properties:

#### Basic Properties
- **Name**: Identifier for the content type
- **Category**: High-level grouping (e.g., "Combat", "Exploration")
- **Description**: Brief explanation of this content type

#### Visual Properties
- **Color**: Primary display color
- **Shape**: Visual representation (circle, square, hexagon, etc.)
- **Size**: Dimensions in meters

#### Distribution Properties
- **Quantity**: Number of instances to place
- **Can Overlap**: Whether it can overlap with other content
- **Biome Restrictions**: Allowed/disallowed biomes
- **Minimum Spacing**: Required distance from same content type

### 4.2 Primary Content Types

#### 4.2.1 Biomes
Large regions with distinct environmental characteristics.
- **Unique properties**: Coverage percentage, edge roughness

#### 4.2.2 Points of Interest (POIs)
Significant locations like structures, landmarks, and facilities.
- **Unique properties**: Size variants, structure type

#### 4.2.3 Enemy Encounters
Combat encounters with hostile entities.
