# Map Visualization Tool - Vanilla Implementation

This is a simplified implementation of the Map Visualization Tool using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without any build tools or frameworks. This approach was chosen to validate the core functionality without the complexity of a build system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this implementation is to:

1. Validate that the core functionality works correctly
2. Test the Canvas API for drawing shapes and grids
3. Verify basic state management with JavaScript
4. Provide a foundation for the full implementation

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and content
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and Canvas manipulation
- **HTML5 Canvas API**: For drawing graphics and visualizations

## Project Structure

```
vanilla/
├── index.html      # HTML structure and content
├── styles.css      # CSS styles for the application
├── script.js       # JavaScript for interactivity and Canvas manipulation
└── README.md       # Documentation
```

## Features Tested

1. **State Management**: A simple counter that updates when clicked
2. **Canvas API**: Drawing a grid, circle, rectangle, and hexagon
3. **Layout**: A responsive layout with cards and containers

## Running the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No build steps or server setup is required.

## Next Steps

After validating that the core functionality works correctly with this vanilla implementation, we can proceed with implementing the full Map Visualization Tool as outlined in the implementation plan, either:

1. Resolving the issues with the React/TypeScript/Vite setup
2. Building upon this vanilla implementation to add the full feature set

The vanilla implementation provides a solid foundation for understanding the core requirements and functionality of the Map Visualization Tool.
