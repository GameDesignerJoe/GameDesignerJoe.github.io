Revised Milestones Plan

Milestone 2: Core Stats and UI Enhancements

Status: Completed

Playable Experience Goal: Provide a functional baseline where players manage their health, stamina, and hunger while visualizing these stats dynamically during gameplay.

Goals:

Implement core stats: health, stamina, hunger.

Dynamic progress bars to visually represent stats.

Automatic health decay when away from Base Camp.

Fix erratic movement on touch devices.

Milestone 3: Environmental Mechanics

Playable Experience Goal: Create an immersive environment where the player must navigate and survive through increasingly challenging terrain and weather conditions, making strategic decisions to conserve stamina and health.

Goals:

Terrain Types:

Introduce terrain tiles such as cliffs, crevasses, and snowfields.

Different terrain types impact stamina usage and require specific tools for traversal.

Weather Effects:

Add dynamic weather, including snowstorms and whiteouts.

Snowstorms hide previously revealed tiles and increase health decay rates.

Temperature and Wind Chill:

Implement a temperature system that dynamically affects health decay based on environmental conditions.

Stretch Goals:

Add environmental hazards, such as collapsing ice or wildlife encounters, to increase tension and unpredictability.

Milestone 4: Map and Exploration Enhancements

Playable Experience Goal: Allow players to explore a randomized, dynamic map with meaningful navigation challenges and tools to aid in exploration.

Goals:

Impassable Terrain:

Add obstacles (e.g., cliffs, crevasses) that force players to find alternate routes.

Random Map Generation:

Implement a system to randomize map layouts for replayability.

Navigation Tools:

Introduce tools like compasses or looking glasses to assist in exploration.

Add map markers for discovered key locations.

Milestone 5: Camp and Rest System

Playable Experience Goal: Introduce a system where players strategically set up camp to recover resources while navigating environmental limitations like weather.

Goals:

Resting:

Add a camp action for recovering stamina and hunger.

Resting requires safe locations and consumes food and fuel.

Weather Interactions:

Snowstorms prevent resting unless specific tools are available (e.g., tents).

Camp UI:

Add a camp-specific UI showing available actions and effects.

Milestone 6: Advanced Gameplay Mechanics

Playable Experience Goal: Deepen the survival mechanics by adding resource management, inventory systems, and desperate actions that highlight the harsh realities of Antarctic exploration.

Goals:

Resource Management:

Introduce items like food rations, fuel, and tools.

Implement an inventory system for players to manage supplies.

Encumbrance System:

Add a weight system affecting movement speed and stamina usage.

Desperation Mechanics:

Allow desperate actions like consuming sled dogs or leather for survival.

Milestone 7: Narrative Systems

Playable Experience Goal: Add narrative depth through event-driven moments, character development, and dynamic storytelling that reflects the player's journey and decisions.

Goals:

Event-Driven Story Moments:

Introduce narrative events triggered by exploration, survival, or weather conditions.

Character Development:

Add text-based moments of reflection or character thoughts tied to survival progress.

Dynamic Narrative:

Adjust narrative outcomes based on player actions (e.g., reaching the South Pole, surviving hardships).

Journal System:

Allow players to document their journey through auto-generated or player-created logs.

Stretch Goals:

Branching narrative paths based on player decisions.

Milestone 8: Replayability and Long-Term Systems

Playable Experience Goal: Ensure players have a reason to return to the game with persistent progression, achievements, and enhanced randomization for varied and engaging runs.

Goals:

Achievements and Unlocks:

Add persistent progression systems like achievements or unlockable items.

Meta-Progression:

Introduce long-term progression mechanics tied to successful or failed runs.

Enhanced Randomization:

Expand map randomization and add more environmental variation for replayability.

Milestone 9: Art Pass & Polish

Playable Experience Goal: Deliver a visually polished and cohesive experience that enhances immersion without distracting from the survival gameplay.

Goals:

Particle Effects:

Add visual effects like blowing snow, wind-driven particles, and frost overlays to simulate the harsh Antarctic environment.

Dynamic Weather Visuals:

Enhance weather systems with smooth transitions, snowstorms, and visual cues for high winds.

Environmental Animation:

Animate interactive elements like flapping tents, swinging ropes, or swaying flags to reflect environmental conditions.

UI Polish:

Refine UI elements for clarity and immersion, ensuring they fit seamlessly into the game's aesthetic.

Start Screen:

Add a start screen with options to begin a new game, view instructions, or adjust settings, providing a professional entry point to the game.
