Here's a summary of what we've been doing:

We're converting your vanilla JavaScript game "Not All Survive" to use React while keeping the core game engine intact. The approach is a hybrid where:
React handles the UI layout and component structure
The original game engine remains largely unchanged but is properly modularized
We're using Vite as the build tool


Current Status:
Basic React setup is working
Game layout is converted to React components
Working on connecting the game engine to React properly
Fixed initial canvas initialization issues


Next Steps:
Debug any remaining canvas rendering issues
Ensure all DOM interactions work properly with React
Test mobile responsiveness
Consider gradual migration of more features to React components

Key Technical Decisions:
Keep the game engine mostly as-is initially
Use React for layout and UI management
Maintain original CSS but prepare for potential Tailwind integration
Use Vite for modern build tooling and development experience


Current Issues Being Worked On:
Canvas initialization timing
DOM element access from game engine
Event listener management
