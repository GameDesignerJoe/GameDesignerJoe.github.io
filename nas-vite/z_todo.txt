TODO List

== TO TEST ==
- If you die during a weather event, I don't think you get your last narrative message. 

== SMALL (GPT) FIXES ==
- Whiteout happens too fast. 
- You should turn all the bars that same color blue when you die.
- Final text gets swallowed by teh stats page. I think if you chnage the padding you should be good. 
- Debug blizzard and white out and health drop don't work.
- Movement shouldn't just automatically take health. 
- Restart button doesn't need to be all floating. It can appear at the bottom of the game screen. 


== BIGGER (CLAUDE) FIXES ==
- Player doesn't say transparent during a Blizzard for some reason. There's a bug there.
- Whiteout isn't working right... it's odd. 
- If you die in the game the restart button doesn't show up.

== MISC ==
- Split out this index.html file into other files at some point.
- Need to make a config file and have them pull all the magic numbers to one place so I can tweak them.


== FUTURE FEATURES ==
- ELEVATION > ++ VISIBIIITY: Have a tile that is a mountain to climb and when you do we pull the view out and let you see a lot more of the tiles around you. 
- GENERAL ELEVAION CHANGES: In fact, I'd like to see the camera go in and out a lot more when you're traveling, even if it's minor. Each tile can have an elevation. High gets you move view, low gets you less. High cost more stamina and has risk of avalahce, low has risk of cave ins and finding an animal's den. 
- NEW TERRAIN TILES: Add in ice caves. 
- Resilience Bar: Need to add a Resilience meter that goes down if you are stationary, back track, or take more than a certain amount of turns to find the sout pole. 
- GEAR VS. TERRAIN: You should have gear that you can bring, or not bring that lets you go through given terrain tiles. Climing gear, kayaks, etc. You can leave them all back on the Endurance or take them with you. However, they all weigh different things so there's a trade off. Also, inventory will have durability so things won't last forever. So the way to the pole, might not be the way home. 
- DEBUG: You're going to have to make a debug system for mobile as well:
    Full Invulerability
    No Health loss
    Kill me now
    No Stamina
    Drain me now
    No Food
    Starve me now
    Reveal Fog of War
    Zoom out map
    Arrived at South pole
    Trigger Blizzard
    Trigger Whiteout
- Consider a radial gradient for the blizzard effect.
- Still need to do a tempurature drop effect. Freeze everything. 
- Should experiment with the size of the grid. Might be nice to try and fill the page and see what that looks like. 
- Try and make every tile unique, or as unique as you can. That way it won't feel like you're just walking over hexes.
