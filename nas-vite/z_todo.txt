TODO List
Don't like the all black coloring for cravasse. 

Wrong font and coloring for main page.

Base camp doesn't do the opening narrative text on first load. 

We need to display status on death that you died. 

The starving to death status should go away after 5 seconds... and maybe come back on a timer of every 15 seconds. 

Popup text goes away too quickly. 

The reaching south pole and coming back home messages need to beccome game messages, not status messages. 

On initialy load the narrative doesn't show up, but on restart it does. 

Blizzard text doesn't clear.
